141. Μ. Lepidus to Cicero (Ad Fam. x. 34 (r. a).)

Pons Aaoauraus, an aa (t), 43 nc. (711 amc.)

1. lihen I heard that Antony was on the march for my province, 1 marched to
oppose him, and have encamped on the Argenteus. He is strong in cavalry and
his infantry is numerous, but not all armed, and he loses many men by desertion.
a. Silanus and Culleo have left him, and I have spared thern, but do not employ

them. I shall do my dnty to the senate and to the commonwealth in this war.

venire, cum exercitu meo ab confluente [ab Rhodano] castra movi
ac contra eos venire institui. Itaque continuis itineribus ad
Forum Voconii veni et ultra castra ad flumen Argenteum contras
Antonianos feci. P. Ventidius suas legiones tres coniunxit cum
eo et ultra me castra posuit; habebat antea legionem quintam
et ex reliquis legionibus magnam multitudinem, sed inermorum.
