Pompey toolr this money ¹, and the war gave rise to other embarrass-
ments ², owing partly to the depreciation os lauded property, partly to
the extravaganee ol Dolabella 3 partly, perhaps, to the mismanagement
ol Terentia ³.

He received, however, various legacies: one from Galeo ⁴, one from
Fufidius ³, and one from M. Cluvius⁸ which produced at first 8o,ooo,
and afterwards roo,0oo sestercesa year. This was in the summer
of 45 nc.

His divorce from Terentia in 46 nc, and the expense of his son's
education, led to fresh, but not very serious embarrassments⁷. His
property seems still to have been substantially unimpaired in the summer
ol 44 ⁸. He needed Atticus' help at times, owing to his difficulty in
getting in money owed him, eg. lrom Faberius ⁰.
