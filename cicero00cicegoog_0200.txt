§ 16. In Gaul, Caesar was occupied in dealing with a most formidable
insurrection, at the head of which stood Vercingetorix, king of the
Arverni. It began with a massacre of the Romans settled at Genabum
(Orleans), and was marked by the capture of Avaricum by the Romans,
and by a repulse of Caesar before Gergovia, followed by a revolt of the
Aedui, old friends of the Romans. Finally, however, Vercingetorix was
obliged to shut himself up in Alesia, where Caesar blockaded him.
A vast force of Gauls marched to the relief of the place, but failed
to force the Roman lines, and Vercingetorix was compelled to sur-
render. Caesar spent the rest of the year at Bibracte¹ (Autun).
His successes were rewarded by the senate with a thanksgiving of
twenty days ².

ln the East, little of importance had happened. The Romans had lost
their hold on Mesopotamia and Armenia, but the Parthians made no
serious attack upon the Roman provinces; thus C. Cassius, who had
been quaestor in Crassus' army, and now commanded in Syria, was able
to reorganize the remains of the Roman army, and, with the help of
Herod Antipater, to subdue a rising of the Jews, who were enraged by
Crassus' plunder of their temple ³.

ξ 17. The consuls for this year were M. Claudius Marcellus, a leader
of the optimates and a man of high personal character, and Servius Sul-
picius Rufus, an eminent and upright jurist, but no politician. At some
time early in the summer, Marcellus ordered a citizen of Notum Cornum
to be scourged⁴, wishing to show his contemptior Caesar, by whom that
town had been reconstituted. Sulpicius, on the other hand, pleaded
for moderati0n³, and pointed out the calamities which must attend
civil war.

It has been mentioned that Pompey’s law ‘de iure magistratuum' pro·
vided that provinces should be govemed by eir-magistrates not imme-
diately after their year of office at Rome, but after an interval of five
years ⁶. This law does not seem to have been retrospective; but the
senate, acting in its spirit, decreed that all men qualified by office, who
had not yet gevemed provinces should assume such govemments, appa-
rently according to seniority⁷. Cicero accordingly had to cast lots for
a consular province, and obtained Cilicia, while Bibulus subsequently
obtained Syria. ,

Cicero's province comprised⁸, besides Cilicia proper, Pisidia, Pamphylia,
