case be incorrect; but of course less so if the term granted by the law
expired in 50, than if it expired in 49 ac.

(b) M. Caelius uses language¹ of which the most natural construction
is that Pompey was prepared to demand Caesar's recall on Nov. 13,
50 nc.

(c) Cicero, wn'ting in the end of 50 nc, speaks*2 of Caesar as having
already held his province for the time allowed by law.

ᾗ 3. ln any case the term granted to Caesar by the ‘Lex Pompeia
Licinia' would expire before the usual time arrived for holding the
consular comitia in 49 nc, the earliest at which he could legally⁸ sue for
a second consulship. It is true that, according to the usage which had
prevaifed for some years before 5² a.c., a successor to him would
only be sent out at the end of 49⁴3 but if he were required to sue for
the consulship in person in the summer of that year, he would have to
relinquish the advantage which constitutional usage thus gave him ; and
if he left the protection of his army before he was elected consul, he
would run great risk of prosecution on various charges. Foreseeing
this, he requested the tribunes in 52 to propose a law, permitting him to
sue for the consulship without apersonal canvass. Pompey supported
this proposal, and it was carried ⁶. Cicero, both directly⁶ and indi·
rectly ², furnishes evidence in support of A. W. Zumpt’s⁸ conjecture, that
the tribunes' law provided that Caesar might retain his command till
after the consular comitia in 49 had been held; Caesar's own language'
has the same tendency ; Appian¹⁰ takes a different view. The enact-
ment of the ‘Lex Pompeia de iure magistratuum'u altered Caesar's
position for the worse in two ways. (r) lt revoled bya general pro-
vision the permission granted him to sue for the consulship while absent
from Rome. (2) By providing that an interval of five years should
elapse between a magistrate's year oi office at Rome and his govem-
ment ofa province, it relieved the senate from the difficulty which that
body might have felt in sending Caesar a successor on March r, 49 a. c.‚
a difficulty which would have arisen from the previous usage that the
govemment of provinces should be assumed by proconsuls or pro-
praetors immediately aller the conclusion of their year of office at
