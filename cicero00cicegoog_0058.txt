TO THE FIRST PART. 17

the consul Bibulus and ol some of the tribunes, the law was sanctioned
by the people, and was followed by another ratifying the acts of Pompey
inAsia¹.

Other laws of the same date were :-

One making concessions to the equites with regard to provincial
taxatiou¹.

One stating the liability to prosecution for extortion (repetundae) of
all who should in any way share the spoils of a guilty provincial
governor. This was the ‘Lex Iulia de repetundis ;’ but Cicero says that
it introduced no novelty³.

One recognising the title of Ptolemy Auletes to the throne of Egypt.
He was not of legitimate descent, and is said to have bought his recog·
nition from the triumvirs for 6000 talents⁴. His brother, who ruled
in Cyprus, was less fortunate ⁵.

Caesar also provided that the senate’s proceedings and other news
should be published in the ‘acta’ or gazette ⁸.

But by far the most important event of this year yae the enactment of
the Lex Vatinia, assignirrg to Caesar the government of Cisalpine Gaul
with Illyricum, and the command of three legions, for five years. P.
Vatinius, one of the tribunes, brought this measure before the people⁷.

The senate had attempted to prevent Caesar’s obtaining such a posi·
tion, by assigning to the two consuls for 59 ac. the duty of repair-
ing roads in Italy on the expiration of their year ol office. But the
manoeuvre had lailed; and now, to avoid aliording another triumph
to the popular party, the senate itself added to Caesar’s province
Transalpino Gaul, with a fourth legion ⁸.

§r8. Caesar, about this time, gave his daughter Julia in marriage
to Pompey, and himself married Calpurnia, daughter of L. Piso, one
of the consuls elect. The other was A. Gabinius, a dependent of
Pompeya

P. Clodius, having been adopted into a plebeian family with questionable
legality ¹⁰, vras elected tribune for 58 a. c. He seems to have imposed on
Cicero with regard to his intentioris ¹¹.

Notwithstanding the strength of their combination, and the promised
support of the consuls elect, the triumvirs were afraid of serious oppo
sirion, and anxious to remove some of the more eminent optimates from
Rome. A mysterious plot, disclosed in one of Cicero's letters, was
supposed to have been formed with this objectu. L. Vettius,a man
