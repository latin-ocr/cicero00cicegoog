3. To repeal a decree ol the senate against the formation os collegia-
clubs, or guilds ¹.

4. To curtail the powers oi the censors¹.

These proposals would, taken together, lind some support from
almost all classes ; ior the powers of the censors were regarded with
dislilre by many oi the nobles, and aiter Sulla's legislation the appoint-
ment oi such officers had been discontinued ior several years ⁸. Having
thus secured his position, Clodius proposed two more laws :-

5. Assigning Syria to Gabinius, and Macedonia, apparently with
Achaia, to Piso, on the expiration ol their consulship ⁴.

6. Enacting, ‘That any one who had put Roman citizens to death
without trial, should be forbidden fire and water ⁸.'

§ao The last measure was evidently directed against Cicera, and
caused great consternation. The senators, the equites, and many
thousand citizens, put on mouming, which the senators, however, were
obliged to lay aside. L. Ninnius, a tribune, and L. Lamia, one oi the
equites, were active in support of Cicero. Opinions differed as to
what he ought to do. He was not named in the law, and some advised
him to stay till a more direct attack was made upon him. L. Lucullus,
in particular, was eager to resort to soree in his desence. To have done
so would perhaps have been in the end the best policy lor the optimates;
in no other cause could they have won so much support lrom the mass
oi moderate and peaceable citizens ; the country towns especially were
devoted to Cicero ⁸. But Pompey‚ to whom earnest appeals were made
on his behalf, declined to intersere, except at the request of the consuls 7;
and the counsels ol Cato and Hortensius, which Cicero’s own family
supported, prevailed. He leit Rome, accordingly, towards the end of
hiarch⁸. On the very day of his departure, Clodius carried a law⁹
banishing Cicero by name: but Cicero's friends got a clause inserted,
allowing him to live anywhere beyond the limitos 400 miles irom Rome ¹⁰.
Alter his departure, his house on the Palatine, and his villas at Formiae
and Tusculum, were pillaged and destroyed; the consuls appropriated
a good deal ol the spoil, and Clodius dedicated the site of the house on
the Palatine to Liberty ¹¹.

Clodius then carried another law, giving Cato a commission to manage
the annexation ol Cyprus, which Cato accepted, though unwillingly¹².
