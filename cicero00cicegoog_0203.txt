sently arrived in Syria, suffered some losses. He was successful, however.
in fomenting discord in the Parthian royal family¹.

Cicero was kept well informcd about the course of events at Rome by
his correspondents there, especially by nl. Caelius, who was elected
curule aedile' for 50 nc. Cicero complained⁸ however, that Caelius
did not write enough on serious subjects. He was very anxious that the
confusion caused by the debates on the consular provinces should not
lead to a prolongation of his own government5 and the letters of
Caelius⁴ and Atticus did not remove this apprehension. He wrote to
congratulate⁶ L. Paulus and C. Marcellus on their election as consuls—
though his real opinion⁶ of Paulus was not fas-ourable-and C. Curio⁷
on his election as tribune.

ξ 21. On Sept. ²9 an important discussion took place in the senate as
to the recall of Caesar from his provinces; but the interposition of two
tribunes, C. Caelius and C. Vibius Pansa, prevented the adoption of any
decisive resolution. The question was to be resumed in 50 n.c., after
March 1⁸. The estrangement of Pompey from Caesar was no secret,
and was attested by various remarks' of the former. Curio had an·
nounced his intention of attacking Caesar, but the first days of his
tribunate were not marked by any active steps¹⁰. hl.Caeliuscomplained¹¹ .
that both consuls showed little energy, and that Paulus was anxious for
aprovincial govemment. Cicero urged all his correspondents to do
their best to prevent his being detained in Cilicia He was importuned
by Caelius to send ¹² him panthers for his shows as aedile, but did not
like to impose on the provincials the burden of providing them ¹⁸.

His long correspondence ¹⁴ with Appius Claudius already alluded to,
must have been annoying. Appius had shown little consideration for
him ¹⁵, in avoiding an interview which Cicero desircd, and in detaining
some of his forces. Yet he afterwards spolie like an injured man ¹⁶.

P. Lentulus Spinther triumphcd this year for successes in Cilicia ¹⁷.

§aa Caesar had to subdue many desultory risings in Gaul. He
brought the Carnutes and Bituriges to submission with ¹little difficulty,
but had to wage a more obstinate struggle with the tribes of the north·
east. There the Atrebates under Commius, and the Bellovaci under
Correus, took up arms and were aided by Ambiorix with the remnant
of the Eburones. Correus, however, fell, and the Bellovaci submitted;
