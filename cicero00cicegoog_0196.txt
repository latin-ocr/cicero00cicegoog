was presently disclosed in the¹ senate. No eleetion toolr place till the
seventh month of 53 rac, according to Dion Cassius ¹.

In the summer of this year, as has been mentioned by anticipation³‚
Pompey’s wile, Julia, died, and received a splendid funeral. Her death
was a great blow to Caesar, both as a father and as a politician.

§ra In the Bast, Crassus succeeded Gabinius as proconsul os Syria,
and prepared for war with the Parthians. Mithridates¹ had been de·
feated and killed during the absence of Gabinius in Egypt, but there was
still much dissension in Parthia. Crassus, however, employed his first
summer in levying heavy contributions on the provinciale, and in
plundering the temples ol Syria and Palestine. His only military
measure was a march into Mesopotamia, in which he met with· few
enemies, and secured some positions of importance for the next year¹s
campaign ¹.

Caesar, meanwhile, after visiting Illyricum, made a second expedition
to¹ Britain. It was ona much larger scale than the first, but seems
only to have secured a nominal recognition of Roman supremacy from
the British prince Cassivellaunus, who consented to pay tribute and to
give hostages. Towards the end ol the year a formidable¹ insurrec-
tion broke out in Gaul, one of its principal leaders being Ambiorix,
lring ol the Eburones, who lived between tho Rhine and the Mense.
The scattered Roman legions were exposed to great peril

53 rac.

§13. This year, as a previous statement implies, opened with a
series of interregna¹. Pompey at length⁹ employed his influence to
bring about an election of consuls, and Cn. Domitius Calvinus and
M. Valerius Messalla were chosen, both ol whom afterwards supported
Caesar. Much confusion prevailed before the election, some urging
that military tribunes should be appointed, others that Pompey should
be dictator.

By far the most important event of the year was the defeat ol Crassus,
followed, on June 9¹⁰, by his murder. This was a tenible blow to
Caesar, for it deprived him, at a very critical moment, of a counterpoise
to Pompey's ascendancy. Caesar was engaged during the greater part
of the year in a desperate struggle with the Belgae, who destroyed two
legions, and reduced a third, commanded by Q. Cicero, to great extre·
mities¹¹. At the end of the year he had, however, restored the supremacy
