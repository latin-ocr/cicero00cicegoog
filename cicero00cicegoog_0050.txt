To THE FIRST PART. 9

may have justified his opposition by the danger to be ieared irom the
removal, but it can hardly be doubted that the sailure of these two
proposals turned the thoughts os many towards revolution.

The popular leaders succeeded, however, in reversing one ol Sulla's
reactionary enactments3 lor the tribune T. Labienus carried a law
restoring the mode of appointing augurs, which Sulla had abolished,
and by which candidates sor admission into the college were nominated
by two members oi it, elected by 17 tribes chosen by lot out os the 35,
and, finally, admitted by the college itseli. It appears that this law also
restored the election os the pontifex maximus to the people ¹.

Cicero advocated in the senatea grant os unusual honours to Pompey.
Α ‘supplicatio' oi twelve days was voted in honour oi his eastern
victories².

Ol the other speeches delivered by Cicero in this year, before his
attention was engrossed by Catiline’s conspiracy, the two most important
were, one spoken to reconcile the people to the precedence enjoyed by
the equites in the theatre under the law of L. Roscius Otho ³, and one in
defence of C. Rabirius ⁴. This man had taken an active part in suppress-
ing the insurrection of Saturninus in the year roo s.c., and was prose·
cuted sor murder, or ‘perduellio’ by Labienus. This trial involved the
question whether the senate could invest the consuls with absolute powers

on appeal before the comitia centuriata.

Cicero introduced a measure relieving the provinces oi a considerable
burden, by limiting the duration of ‘legationes liberae’ to one year ⁶.

§ro It does not appear how soon Cicero became aware of the
resumption of the treasonable designs ol Catiline. He lost no time,
however, in securing his colleague Antonius to the cause of order.
Macedonia and Cisalpine Gaul had been assigned as the provinces to
be govemed by the consuls ior ⁶3 ac, on the expiration oi their year
oi office. Cicero allowed his colleague to obtain Macedonia ⁷, which
he desired, and, renouncing his own claim to govern a province at all,
contrived that Cisalpine Gaul should be secured to Q. Metellus Celer, one
ol the praetors for ⁶3· Cicero addressed the people on the subject ⁸.

It is uncertain how sar the conspirators were supported by menos
high position discontented with the government. Both Caesar and
Crassus were seriously suspected, but, if the latter was really privy
