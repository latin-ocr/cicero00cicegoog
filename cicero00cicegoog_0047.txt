6 INTRODUCTION

His lieutenants‚ also, in Armenia and Pontus, were defeated by Mithri·
dates, and he was successively deprived of the govemment of Asia and
Cilicia, and of the conduct of the war. The officer named to succeed
him in the last duty, Μ’. Acilius Glabrio, declined, however, to act 3 but
Lucullus could only standon the defensive near the Upper Halys ¹.

Pompey, on the other hand, executed his commission to suppress
piracy with brilliant success, and passed the winter of 67-66 ac. in
Cilicia, preparing, apparently, to act against Q. Metellus in Crete ², who
declined to recognise the supremacy granted to Pompey, by the law of
Gabinius, over all provincial governors.

ξ 8. Such was the position of affairs when Cicero entered on his
praetorship in the beginning of 66 rac. He presided in the court which
tried cases of extortion (quaestio repetundarum), and appears to have
acted tvith integrity ³, especially on the trial of the wealthy C. Licinius
Macer ⁴. He delivered various speeches before other tribunals; among
others, that on behalf of Α. Cluentius Habitus.

The most important event of the year 66 rac, both for Rome and for
Cicero, was the enactment of the Lex Manilia, transferring to Pompey the
command against Mithridates, with the govemment of Pontus, Bithynia,
and Cilicia, while he was to retain the commission he held to act against
the pirates. Cicero earnestly supported this measure, in a speech still
extant ⁶, and his attachment to the great general had so important an
influence on his subsequent career, that we may pause to consider briefly
its nature and grounds.

Pompey had done more than any contemporary to reverse the
measures of Sulla. Though not, like Cicero, a ‘novus homo,' he
was by no means of high nobility; and his supporters were mainly
to be found among the equites, the middle classes in the country
districts, and at times among the populace of the capital, as was the
case, to a great extent, with Cicero himself. Both in Spain and in
Asia Pompey had displayed courage and judgment; and he was a
good husband and father. Thus, as a successful general, a moderate
politician, and a Roman of old-fashioned morality, Pompey acquired

ι an ascendancy over Cicero, which the errors and inconsistencies of his

later conduct never entirely destroyed.

Tullia was betrothed in 66 nc. to C. Calpurnius Piso, but apparently
not married for some years ⁸.
