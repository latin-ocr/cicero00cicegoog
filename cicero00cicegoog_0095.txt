with the dative, meaning ‘to insert in,’

Prof. Tyrrell suggests ‘incudem'

A. d. 111, Non. . . animadverteram,
‘1 had noticed, before yon told me, that
the date, Dec. 3, was wrong! 1 cannot
find ns to what work Cicero makes this
confession.

5. dressrirrepa. Apparently = 'more
classical,' ‘more correct,‘ with an allusion,
perhaps, to Atticus¹ name. 1 cannot hnd
that the word is used quite in this sense
in classical Greek.

6. Metellinam. Against Metellus

7. Philorhetora, ‘a lover of oratory.’
The word seems only to be found here.

12. Teucris. Many suppose C. Auto-
nius, Cicero’s colleague, to be meant.
But another suggestion is, that Cicero
refers to a rich woman from whom he
had borrowed money. Mr. Pretor's note
on Ad Att. 1. 12 induces me to look with
more favour than 1 did presiously on the
identificatiou of ‘Teucris' with C. Anto·
nius. A passage in Persius (1. 4.) may
be quoted in illustration of the use of
such a term for an effeminate Roman.

13. Eiet in spe, ‘there ishope that she

elliptieai. For the phrase ‘ in spe esse,’
