After executing, with complete success, his commission to suppress
piracyfcp.1ntr.to Part 1‚§ 7), Pompey had passed the winter of 67-
66 ac. in Cilicia, where he received the news of the extended powers
conferred upon him by the law of Manilius (supra, ξ 8). He levied
a considerable force, and with it met Lucullus at Danala ¹, in Galatia,
where, after a warm discussion, he amalgamated that general's forces
with his own. Before the close of the year he had completely defeated
Mithridates at Nicopolis, and driven him across the Phasis, while

Tigranes sued for peace, and obtained it on paying a large sum of '

money, and surrendering all his possessions except Annenia Proper. ,
The close of 66, and nearly the whole of 65, were occupied with success·
ful campaigns against the Albaniana and Iberians; the close of 65, and
the beginning of 64, with the suppression of the last efforts at resistance
in Pontus.

Pompey then marched southwards, to complete the conquest of Syria
which sume of his officers had begun. By the end of 63 ac. the Roman
sovereignty was completely established there, and Pompey then began
to organize his conquests. Two new provinces, Syria and Crete ², were
formed; three older ones, Asia, Bithynia, and Cilicia, were reconstituted.
Bithynia received part of Pontus; the new province of Cilicia corn·
prised, besides Cilicia proper, which had been won by Pompey, Pam·
phylia‚ Pisidia, Isauria, Lycaonia, and part of Phrygia. Pompey founded
many towns in Cilicia, Cappadocia, and elsewhere, and gave a corporate
existence to others. Many of the captive pirates were settled in these towns.

He had also in 63 nc. defeated the Jews under Aristobulus, and taken
Jerusalem, but he did not reduce Judaea to the condition of a Roman
province, preferring to leave its govemment to Hyrcanas, a rival of
Aristobulus.

Meanwhile, Mithridates tried to organize means of resistance in the
Tauric Chersonese, but his suspicions cruelty caused a revolt, headed by
his son Pharnaces, and he died by his own hand in 63 ac.

Thus, towards the end of 63 ac, Pompey had completed his taslr.
The Parthians were probably indignant at the advance of the Roman
power, but showed no disposition to begin hostilities. Cp. Vel. a. 333
