aa existing at Lavinium (cp. A. W. Zumpt, De Lavinio, etc, pp. ²3
14,15), but perhaps no argument can be drawn from the institutions
of the first century of the empire, and Mommsen thinks that he re·
presented the municipal, not the Roman, praetor. (Staatsrecht z. 569-
570, note 8.)

All these municipia and praefecturae probably, with the exception of
Capua and a few places in its neighbourhood, had received the full
Roman franchise before the enactment of the ‘Lex Iulia,' and most of
the praefecturae may bave obtained the right of electing their own
magistrates on receiving such full citizenship. Cp. Marquardt 1. 34;
423 43·

The status of the praefecturae would thus be a transitional one: but
cp. pp. 619-620.

The position of Capua between the first establishment of its connec-
tion with Rome and its revolt in the second Punic war (343-216 ac.)
presents some difficulty. It is said by Livy (8. ι4) to have received
the ‘civitas sine suffragio' in 338 a.c., cp. Velleius 1. 14 ; but it is
still spoken osas a ‘civitas foederata’ by Livy at later periods (9. 6 ;
23. 5), and it appears that a magistrate, the meddix tuticus, was still
elected there up to the year arr a. c. Cp. Livy 23, 353 Mommsen,
Oskische Studien, rra. Perhaps the gradual disappearance of the old
municipal relation led toa confusion of it with that of the civitates
foederatae. Cp. Marquardt 1. 31.

The inhabitants of the municipal towns of the older lind served in
legions of their own, but under tribunes, thus holding an intermediate
position between that of the full Roman citizens and that of the allies.
They are sometimes called Roman citizens (fest. 142), sometimes not
(Paul. Diae, Fest. 127). In the latter case the title is probably denied
them as not being enrolled in the tribes. Cp. Marquardt 1. 32,

and notes.

1. Old Latin towns, of which Tibur, Praeneste, and perhaps Lau·

a considerable extent after the revolt and subjugation of Latium
in 338 ac. Cp. Livy 8. rr ; 14.

2. Coloniae Latinae. The population of such of these as were
founded after the subjugation of Latium probably consisted
partly of Latins, partly of indigent Romans who sacrificed some
of their privileges as citizens to obtain a grant of land in such
