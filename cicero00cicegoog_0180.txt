order, aggravated perhaps in the first instance by maltreatment. He
abstained from food, thinking the case desperate, and died March 31,
3² nc.

ξό. He was extremely wealthy; besides his uncle's legacy, he had
inherited two million sesterces from his father. About the year 69 nc.
he had bought a considerable estate near Buthrotum in Epirus, and
he had perhaps properties at Sybota and in Corcyra ¹, and large sums
at interest in Sicyon, Macedonia, and Delos ². He seems to have
been moderate in his demands os interest, but prompt in exacting
repayment.

His expenditure, both on his houses and on his table, was moderate-
at least compared with that oi other wealthy Romans; he had a fine
house with gardens on the Quirinal, a villa close to Rome, and estates at
Ardea, at Nomentum, and near Lucretilis. On his estate at Buthrotum
stood the Amaltheum-an apartment or shrine containing groups oi
mythological personages‚ and busts of eminent Romans, with a few
lines of poetry under each, of his own composition. Cicero's was
among them. Cicero asked Atticus to collect works ol art sor him
in Greece⁸.

The slaves ol Atticus were valuable as copyists or readers ; some oi
them seem to have been trained as gladiators⁴.

His knowledge of and fondness sor literature were remarkable; he
wrote a Greek account of Cicero's consulship, a compendium ol Roman
history, and various genealogical works. He spoke and wrote both
Greek and Latin with great elegance and propriety. His knowledge oi
dates and os antiquities generally was remarkable, and his power
of rapid calculation still more so ⁶. In philosophy he seems to have
inclined to Epicureanism ⁶.

§ 7. He was placablc and affectionate as a son, husband, and father,
and an honest, il not very energetic, friend. He was on intimate terms
with many ol his eminent contemporaries3 traces may be found of an
intimacy between him and the Claudii⁷3 and among his acquaintance
were Pompey⁸, Q. Hortensius, M. Varr0, Q. Gellius Canus, A. Torquatus,
Q. Metellus Celer. Caesar was pleased by his not leaving Italy during
the first civil war ⁹.

His sister Pomponia married Q. Cicer0, but the marriage was not
happy, and seems to have been terminated by a divorce about 45 or
44 n.c.¹⁰

Atticus had a daughter-Pomponia or Caecilia Attica—born 51 a. c.¹¹
She married M. Agrippa, at Antony's suggestion, about 3⁶ ;· their daughter
