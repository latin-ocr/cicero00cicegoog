49² APPENDIX VIII.

November and December two intercalary months instead os January and
February: for as ⁴⁶ would naumily end with February, and he intended
4⁵ ιο begin with Janinry, the repetition of two months so soon nster each
other would cause confusion ,· (z) to add ten days ιο the year, which
seem to have been appendet] to the ‘mens'm intercalaris posterior!

The ordinary year from ⁴5 ιο. was one of 365 days, buz to com-
plete the quadrennial eycle the insertion of one day every saur years
was requisite, and this took place in Fehmry zster the vr. cal. Man.
The extra day was called ‘bis vr eal. Mam: whenoe the term bissextile
sur leap year. 45 ιο. was a leap year. Cp. Mommsen, Ramisehe
ehmn. 279-281. The Julian yeni- of 365 days ⁶ houm exceeded the
nolnr year by about eleven minutes. Α table is appended οἰ the dnys on
