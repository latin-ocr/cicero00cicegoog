sit, hortatio non est necessaria, gratulatione magis utendum est:
contigit enim tibi quod haud scio an nemini, ut summa severitas
animadversionis non modo non invidiosa, sed etiam popularis
esset et cum bonis omnibus tum infimo cuique gratissima. Hoc
si tibi fortuna quadam contigisset, gratularer felicitati tuae ; sed 5
contigit magnitudine cum animi tum etiam ingenii atque consilii;
legi enim contionem tuam: nihil illa sapientius ; ita pedetemptim
et gradatim tum accessus a te ad causam facti, turn recessus, ut
res ipsa maturitatem tibi animadvertendi omnium concessu daret.
sLiberasti igitur et urbem periculo et civitatem metu, neque solum ro
ad tempus maximam utilitatem attulisti, sed etiam ad exemplum.
Quo facto intellegere debes in te positam esse rem publicam tibi-
que non modo tuendos, sed etiam ornandos esse illos virosa qui·
bus initium libertatis profectum est. Sed his derebus coram plura
propediem, ut spero : tu quoniam rem publicam nosque conservas, ¹5
fac ut diligentissime teipsum, mi Dolabella, custodias.
