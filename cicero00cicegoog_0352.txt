To THE Turno enat: 303

apparently. His fasces were still wreathed with laurei for his successes
in Cilicia, and the notoriety¹ this gave his movements increased the
anxiety which all his letters of this time express ³, and which was aggra-
vated by his doubts, how he could secure the safety of his wife and
daughter without, by sending them to³ Rome, declaring his distrust of
Pompey's prospects. While moving about he had interviews⁴ with
Pompey, and with the consuls: the dates of his movements seem to have
been as follows :-

He left Rome between January 12⁸ and 213 was at Mintumae⁶ on
the 23rd, and went to Capua' on the 25th, where he probably received,
through Trebatius ⁸, an invitation from Caesar to return to Rome. He
stayed at Capua till the 28th, when he lest for Formiae ’‚ and was
rej0ined by his wife ¹⁰ and daughter on Febntary ²3 revisited Capua on
the 5th at the invitation of the consuls, and stayed there ¹¹ two days,
returning to Formiae on the 7th, where he received a letter ¹² from
Pompey inviting him to go to Luceria. He left Formiae as though
to comply with this request, but presently returned ¹⁸, and re-
mained in Formiae till early in March ¹⁴ apparently. He probably
received there a letter ¹⁵ from Caelius, in praise of Caesar's clemency.

§ 4. His letters follow one another very quickly during these months.
He expresses anxiety ¹⁶ as to the fate of his wife and daughter, finally de·
ciding ¹⁷ to keep them with him for the present. He disapproves of the
terms offered by Caesar, yet thinks it most expedient ¹⁸ to grant them;
desponds at the sight of the general confusion at Capua and Formiae,
the weakness and irresolution of Pompey and the taiture¹⁹ of his levies ;
renews his old complaints of the past blindness of Pompey in allowing
Caesar’s rise ²⁰, and of the impracticability of Cato ¹¹3 testifies to the in-
difference or despondency of large classes²² and districts, and to Caesar's
popularity in the country towns and villages ¹⁸. He admires the speed
and vigour of Caesar²t fears the cruelties²⁶ which might follow the
triumph of Pompey, and reminds²⁶ the latter significandy how he had
suffered before for his patriotism, owing to Pompey’s desertion. He
therefore felt reluctant to leave ²⁷ Italy, or even to follow Pompey to
