TULLIUS S. D. TERENTIAE ET TULLlOLAE ET CICERONI SUIS.

1 Noli putare me ad quemquam longiores epistolas scribere, nisi
si quis all me plura scripsit, cui puto rescribi oportere ; nec enim
habeo quod scribam, nec hoc tempore quicquam difficilius faci0.
Ad te vero et ad nostram Tulliolam non queo sine plurimis
lacrimis scribere3 vos enim video esse miserrimas, quas ego 5
beatissimas semper esse volui idque praestare debui, et, nisi tam

2timidi fuissemus, praestitissem. Pisonem nostrum merito eius
amo plurimum: eum, ut potui, per litteras cohortatus sum gra-
tiasque egi, ut debui. In novis tribunis pl. intellego spem te
habere: id erit firmum, si Pompeii voluntas erit, sed Crassum 10
tamen metuo Ate quidem omnia fieri fortissime et aman-
tissime video‚ nec miror, sed maereo casum eius modi, ut tantis
tuis miseriis meae miseriae subleventur: nam ad me P. Valerius,
homo officiosus, scripsit, id quod ego maximo cum fletu legi,
quem ad modum aVestae ad tabulam Valeriam ducta esses. ¹5
