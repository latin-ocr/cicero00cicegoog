ς 5. Pompey returned from Spain in 71 mc„ md seems to have put
himself in wmmunicntion with erasm, with the more moderate party
in the senate, und with the leaders os the demoemts. He was anxious
to obtain the distinctions oi* a triumph and consulship, md could not
legally enjoy either ¹, The motives of Crusxus iu supporting him are
not very clean but to the democrats the nid os the greatest gener-al
os the time was invaluahle.

The results oi this power-sul combiuafion, which seems to have been
effected in the summer os 7r ule.. speedily appeared. Pompey and
Crassus were elected oonsnls for 70 mc. Pompey obtained the triumph
he desired⁷ and, with his colleague, proposed or supported the measures

the next year, when Verres’ advocate Hortensius would be consul, and
the composition os ihc court might be more favour-able. Eut Cioero's
vigilnnce bnffled them. He made only a short speech in opening the
cnse, and then summoned the witnesses, whose diseias-ires were so
overwhelming that Hortensius gave up the defence, and Verres went
into exile. 'l‘he affair may have contributed to the enaclment os the
Lex Aurelia mentioned above5 and, to decpcn ihc impression which
it made, Cicero published five speeches which he might have delivered
