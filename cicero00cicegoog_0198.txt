riage connection, and married Cornelia ¹, the daughter oi Q. Metellus
Scipio. Her father became his colleague lor the last five months of
his consulship.

Pompey now proposed and carried a series of important mensures.

r. Laws against riot (‘vis’) and corruption (ambitus), which prescribed
a briefer and stricter process and heavier penalties. Perhaps² that on
‘vis' declared it illegal to keep arms in Rome.

a. A law ‘de iure magistratuum ⁸‚' providing that candidates must
attend to canvass in person, and that five years⁴ should elapse between
holding office at Rome and the government oi a province ⁸. Pompey
violated this law, however, in his own case, by procuring an enactment
which

3. Secured him the⁶ govemment of Spain ior five years more.

The general effect oi these mensures was— 1. To limit² the freedom
ol sorensic oratory. 2. To check the activity ol political clubs by the
greater probability oi the punishment os illegal practices. 3. To place
the provincial govemments⁸ more directly under the control oi the
senate. 4. To embarrass Caesar, by requiring him to suasor the con·
sulship in person, as he would thus abandon the protection of his army,
and would be exposed to great danger. For 5. the operation ol the
laws against riot and corruption was extended retrospectively to the year
70 u.c.⁸; and thus the proceedings ol Caesar in 60-59 nc. might be
called in question under it.

Pompey had, however, approved ol a law brought in by the ten tri·
bunes, among whom M. Caelius was prominent, dispensing in Caesar's
favour with the necessity of a personal eanvass sor the consulship ; and
when it was pointed out to him that the law ‘de iure magistratuum'
withdrew this concession, Pompey granted it again by an appended
clause ¹⁰ ol questionable validity. Cicero attached great importance ¹¹ to
this concession, but is inconsistent in the account ¹² he gives of his own
behaviour in the matter.

ξ r 5. Milo was accused ol riotous proceedings (‘vis’) early in April by
Ap. Claudius Pulcher (maior), P. Valerius Nepos, and M. Antonius.
