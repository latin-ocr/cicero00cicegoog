hood oi Rome ¹.

An important meeting oi the senate took place on June ι’, when
Macedonia was assigned to Antony‚ and Syria was assigned about the same
time by a vote os the people³ to Dolabella, who then finally broke with
the republican leaders. On the 5th‚ apparently, Μ. Brutus was released
irom his obligation to reside iu Rome as praetor ⁴, and, with C. Cassius,
commissioned to supply corn. Both remained, however ⁵, in Italy to
see what effect might be produced by the Ludi Apollinares· celebrated
in the name ol M. Brutus ou the yth of Quinctilis, now iirst called Iulius⁷.
The people applauded, but their cheers were not l'ollowed by any im·

April, and erchanged friendly letters¹³ with Antony as to the restoration
oi one Sex. Clodius from exile. His gratification at the vigorous mea-
sures ol Dolabella has been already ¹⁴ mentioned.

The landing oi Octavius ¹⁶ at tirst gave him no pleasure, and he was
alarmed by the prospect os civil war ¹⁶ with D. Brutus and Sex. Pompeius,
and by rumours that Antony would attempt to seize the Gallie pro·
vinces ¹⁷. He had not as yet¹⁸ much confidence in the consuls elect
Hirtius and Pansa, but was pleased with an edict¹⁹ oi Brutus and Cassius.
in which they seem to have held moderate language‚ dismissing the
friends who came from the country towns to protect thern. The re
grets, however, openly expressed²⁰ for Caesar by Manus and others

disquieted him, nor was he much reassured by a correspondence²¹ with
Matius
