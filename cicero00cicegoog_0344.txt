tutional principles.

ξ 1. The ‘Lex Vatinia' os 59 nc. gave Caesar the government ol
Cisalpine Gaul with Illyricum, and an army ol three legions, for a term
ol five years, to expire on March 1¹, 54 nc. Then‚ perhaps on the
death² os Q. Metellus Celer, proconsul ol Gallia Narbonensis, the senate
added that province, with another legion, to Caesar's governrnent. This
grant was renewed annually; and an attempt to get one os his two pro·
vinces assigned by anticipation to another governor in March 54 sailed ³.
In 55 a tribune, C. Trebonius, got a law enacted securing the govern-
ment ol Syria to Crassus lor five years, and that ol the two Spains to
Pompey lor a like period. Perhaps they had already obtained these
provinces lor one year by regular allotment ⁴. Then the two consuls,
Pompey and Crassus, proposed a law extending Caesar’s government ol
the two Gauls sor five years ³.

ξ a. From what day did this second term ol five years date? Three
have been suggested.

1. Jan. 1, 54 nc.

a. March 1, 54 nc.

3. The day os the enactment os the consular law in 55 tte, sup-
posed to have been Nov. 13.

For 1, little can be said, except that it was the day on which magis-
trates began their year of office.

Velleius⁷‚ Appian ⁸, and Plutarch ⁹, which spealr ol a real addition of
live years to Caesar's govemmenr.

For 3, that

would expire next year; and in another place ¹¹, that the law ol 55 added
