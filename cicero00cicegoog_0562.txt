TO THE FIFTH PART. , 515

Rome¹ to demand the consulship for him, the senate refused him leave
to stand, on account of his age. His soldiers, when the deputation
returned, demanded to be led to Rome, and he complied¹ with their
wish. He had eight legions, with cavalry and light troops, and the
news of his advance caused a great panic. lt was allayed, however,
for a time by the arrival of the African legions'; they were eneamped,
together with one left behind by Pansa, for the defence of the city,
and new levies were ordered. But the African legions consisted in
great measure of old soldiers of Caesar; Octavius probably did not
spare promises, and on his approach the troops which should have
opposed him submitted to him ⁴. The senate was now defenceless;
the praetor M. Cornutus slew himself, and Cicero went to greet
Octavius, who replied to his salutation in ambiguous terms. In the
night a rumour was spread⁵ abroad that two legions had revolted
against Octavius, and Cicero and the senate regained courage for
a moment, but were speedily undeceived.

Nothing now remained but submission3 the necessary forms were
hurried through, and Octavius was elected consul⁸ in his aoth year,
with Q. Pedius for his colleague. The news of this event produced
great effects in the provinces; Pollio seems at once to have declarcd
for Antony and Lepidus. Plancus remaincd faithful to the senate for
sometime longer, till Pollio affected by his mediation a reconciliation
between him and Antony'. D. Brutus was now quite unable to hold
his ground, and desertion rapidly thinned his ranlrs. He resolved‚
therefore, to try to force his way to bl. Brutus, and by a difficult route
reached Aquileia, where he fell into the hands of a Gauiish chief to
whom he had formerly done service, but who now killed him at Antony’s
bidding, probably in October ⁸.

§ao M. Brutus, meanwhile, had captured· C. Antonius, but treated
him very well at first. He secured his position in Greece, and after
visiting Asia, returned to Europe, and obtained successes against some
Thracian tribes, which, however, were a poor compensation for his
absence from Italy at a critical moment¹⁰. The operations of Cassius
had been more important; after the battle of Mutina the senate
