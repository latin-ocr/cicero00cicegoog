PREFACE

TO THE FOURTH EDITION¹

Ι UNDERTOOK the preparation of an edition of Select Letters
of Cicero for the Clarendon Press Series at the suggestion of the
late Professor Conington, to whose advice and criticisms 1 was
much indebted in the earlier part of my work.

The text which 1 have adopted is that of Baiter and Kayser's
edition, Leipzig, 1860-69. In the few cases—not exceeding ten
or twelve—in which I have departed from it, 1 have always re·
ferred to the departure in a note, and in the majority of them
I have merely substituted the reading of the MS. which Baiter
recognizes as of sole or highest authority. 1 have not always ·
adopted Baiter's punctuation, and have departed at times from
his spelling, for the sake of clearness or of uniformity.

This does not pretend to be a critical edition of the letters,
but Ι have thought that some of those who use it may be glad
to have an account, even imperfect, of the manuscripts laid before
them. My knowledge os manuscript readings is mainly derived
from the editions of Orelli, Baiter and Kayser, Hofmann, Tyrrell,
and Wesenberg; suggestions os other scholare, among whom Ι
may especially name MM. Cobet, Lehmann, and Streicher, and
Mr. L. C. Purser, will be found in the notes.

For the letters ‘Ad Familiares' the Medicean MS. (Plut.
XLIX, No. IX) is, according to Baiter, the sole original au·
thority, except one page os a Turin palimpsest. The Medicean
—referred to by critics as M.—is thought to belong to the ninth
or tenth century, and, with an early copy (Plut. XLIX, VII), is
kept in the Laurentian library at Florence. The discovery of

f ¹t1dhtuve incorporated with this Prefuoe a considerable portion of that to the
irs e rron.
