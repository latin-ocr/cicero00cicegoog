¹ r. Iseut you a most pressing summous by Numestius but do uot be anxious, the
affair for which Ι wanted you will not, 1 hope, turn cut so ill as I feared. a. Vettius,
my old agent, bus contrived a plot for the ruin of the younger Curio aud others. He
charged Curio with conspiriug for the murder of Pompey, but had iu reality suggested
that cume to Curio, who warned Pompey through his own father. 3. Vettius was
guilty of many contradictions, aad was imprisoned, but afterwards brought before the
people by Caesar. He made several changes in the list of alleged conspiratum, aud
biuted that I was one of them, without naming me. 4. He now awaits his trial for
‘vin' aud, lf convicted, will probably ask to be allowed to inform against others In
that case there must be more trials, but I do not fear their result. I receive mauy
promises of support, but am sicli of life, so wretched are the times. The bold lan·
guage of Considius has dispelled our fears of a massacre,but1have still reason enough
to cuvy Catulus. 1 show uo wealruess, however. 5. Pompey bids rue not to fear
Clodius, aud is generally most friendly in bis language. 1 am most anxious for your
advice and sympathy.
