INTRODUCTION.

48-47 rac.

§ 1. Arrun his landing in Italy, Cicero remained for some months at
Brundisium, where he heard¹ ol the sate of several ol the leaders ol his
party. Hc was disquieted by many troubles; it was with some difficulty
that he obtained¹ leave to remain in Italy from Antony, 'Caesar's repre·
sentative;‚his brother and nephew, who had gone to make their peace
with Caesar in Asia, seem to have calumniated³ him; his daughter’s
marriage was unhappy ⁴, and he had some difficulty in paying her dowry;
while he was by no means satisfied with the conduct of Terentia ⁶, to
whose extravagance he attributed, in great measure, his existing em-
barrassments. Above all, however, he was seriously alarmed by the
aspect ol public affairs Hc had returned to Italy under the impression ’

that the war was virtually at an end ⁸ ; but Caesar’s delay at Alexandria ⁷, .

and the reports which were circulated of the growing strength of the
optimates in Africa⁸ dispelled this hope, and he accused himself os pre·
cipitation-especially as a proclamation of Antony, which gave him leave
by name to remain in Italy, would mark him out for the suspicion of the
optimates in case of their ultimate success ⁰.

Harassed by these anxieties‚ he remained at Brundisium till the Sep·
tember ol 47 a. c., when Caesar ¹⁰ lauded at Tarentum alter his victories
