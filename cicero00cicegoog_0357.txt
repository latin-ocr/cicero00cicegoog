ι4οὸ ΙιΥΪΚΟΒΟὉΤΙΟΝ Τ 0 THE THIRD PART.

irum Syria A decisive battle was fought near Pharsalus on August

⁹¹ ; and, in spite ol Caessr's great inferiority ol numbers, especially in

cavalry, it resulted in a complete victory ior him 1. Domitius Aheno·

barbus iell in the tout ; Pompey, giving up bis cause for lost, fled to
‚ Egypt ; his friends dispersed ².

i ra. ln Italy some trouble was caused by the turbulent proceedings
ol hl. Caelius Rufus, one ol tbe praetors He had previously⁸ err·
pvemtd to Cicero his discontent 'with Caesar, and now proposed⁴
micus laws, grantirig to debtors terms more lavourable than Caesar
had offerat them. Caelius was opposed by C. Trebonius, one os his ool-
terme und by the consul Servilius, and was suspended hy the senate.
ln rerenge he sent messages to Milo, who came to Italy, and the
two together attempted to stir up a servile war. Both, however,
were killed without effecting anything ⁵. In a letter to Cicero, mentioned
above, Caelius had affirmed that discontent with Caesar was general, ex·
cept among the great money-lenders. Dion Cassius· describes opinion
ns really divided, but apparently favourable to Caesar. He allows, how-
ever, that Pompey's probable cruelty aiter success was leared Appian'
says that the people was anxious ior a peaceable settlement, and knew
that in case oi a decisive battle the victor must become its master. These
two statements are consistent with each other and probable, bnt we do
not know on what contemporary authority they rest.

ξ 13. In Africa, aster the death of Curio, the Pompeians and Juba
had apparently not been disturbed.

In Spain, the governor leit by Caesar, Q. Cassius Longinus ⁸, was
very oppressive, and a plot was formed against his lile. The conspirators
attached him when he was revicwing his army at Corduba. Cassius,
however, escaped, though severely wounded, and renewed his severities.
Part os his army then mutinied, and placed M. Marcellus Aeserninus, the
quaestor, at its head. He did not disown his allegiance to Caesar, and
was supported by M. Lepidus, proconsul ⁹ ol Hither Spain. These dis·
orders were put a stop to next year hy the arrival os Trebonius to
assume the government ol Spain as proconsul ¹⁰, whereon Cassius de-
parted, and was drowned near the mouth ol the Ibems. Precious time
had been lost for Caesar, for he had wished that Cassius should invade
Africa from Spain ¹¹.
