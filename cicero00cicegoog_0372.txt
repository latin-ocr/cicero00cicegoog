54. To Atticus (Ad Att. viii. 3).

Naar Canas, moun Fan. 19, 49 nc. (705 nuc.)

1. 1 am anxious for your advice as to what Ι ought to do if Pompey leaves Italy.
lwill set both sides oi the question before you as fairly as Ι cau. a. Pompey’s services
to me, and our intimacy, seem to make it a duty to stand by him, and if 1 remain at
Rome Ι must fall into the power of Caesar. His langnage is friendly, bnt how can
1 live without influence and witha prospect of disgrace in ease of Pompey& successi
3. On the other hand, Pompcy’s mistakes have been many and serious, and he has
never taken my advice: to omit his earlier errore, what ean be worse than his present
flight from Romel 4 ‘But he will recover it’ Wheni His mensures have hitherto
been ill-conceived aud disastrous. Irelnctantly took charge of Capua, and conld
mark the general apathy. 5. How can ijoin Pompey at this seasont 6. ΙΙΙ stay at
Rome l shall do no worse than Q. Mucius did under the tyranny of Cinna But the
‘imperium’ which Ι retain would even then embarrass me. 1 hope you will not
infer from all this that my choice is made, bnt will advise me impartially. Ihave
a vessel ready at Caieta, and another at Brundisium. 7. l have just received news
that Caesar is opposed at Corfinium by Domitius with an effective army. Ι do not
think Pompey will desert Domitius, though his mensures look suspicions We hear
reporta, which Ι do not believe, of successes won by Afranius over Caesar’s officers.
I write from Formiae.
