ln 50 noa struggle, os which the particulars have been already¹
notieed, toolr place between Pompey's friends and Curio. It must be
renierulnved, that Pompey held his provinces³ by virtue ol a law passed
ln 5³, tend might fairly decline to surrender them in obedience to amere
expression ol opinion on the partos the senate.

On the first day os 49 nc, Curio⁴ appeared in Rome with very
moderate propossls lrom Caesar 3 his friends among the tribunes com-
pellcd the consuls to read the proposals in the senate, but the consuls
deelined to put them to the vote.

The senate was intimidated by the two consuls, and by Scipio acting
as Pompey's spohesman: and many ol Pompey’s soldiers· filled the
capital ⁶.

Caesar was required to hand over his provinces to two successore by·
s certain day. Two tribunes, M. Antonius and Q. Cassius, vetoed this
demand, and their veto was probably regular, as one ol the two suc-
cessors selected was only os praetorian rank ⁶. The veto was answered,
however, by a vote' investing the consuls and other magistrates with
extraordinary powers; on which Antony and Cassius fied lrom Rome.
hluch irregularity⁸ seems to have marked the provisions subsequently
made by the senate sor the govemmcnt ol the provinces

those which, under the ‘Iex Pompeia dc inre magistratuum· would be governed hy
consulares. For its usual meaning-those to be assigned to the ncxt consuls-is
excluded hythe cnsctment ol that law which interposed an interval οἱ five years
between the consulship and the govemment ol s consular province. Intr. to Part 11,
