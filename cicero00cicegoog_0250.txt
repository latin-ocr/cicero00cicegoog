ar. 29.] AD FAMILIARES I. 9. 201

'l'he support Ι have given to Caesar is* represented as a defection from my old party.
But, my dear Lentulus, γοα will find the whole aspect ol politica changed3 18. and
wise citizens ought to change their views accordingly. Plato preferred to abstain from
public life altogether; my position is different from his, and Caesar's public services
and private liberality both give him a claim on my support. 19. Ι can now auswer
your questions about Vatinius and Crassus—l was urged by Caesar to defend Vatinius,
and my testimony on his behalf was not stronger than that which you have borne in
favour of various people. Ihad a hrrther reason for my conduct; my support of
Vatinius was a fair retaliation for that which certain nobles gave to Clodius. ιο.
Crassus, after we had been reconciled, aroused my indignatiou by unexpectedly under-
taking the defence of Gabinius and attacking me. Eut 1 heard that some people were
exulting at the prospect of a permanent breach between us, and so 1 listened to the
eamestentreaties of Pompey and Caesar that Ι would be reconciled to him. ar. Ishould
probably have acted as Ι have done even if no personal reasons had intervened; but I
will own that Caesar's remarkable gratitude aud generosity have influeuced me, and 1
need powerful protection against the plots of my enemies. π. Had you been present
γοα would, l think, have approved my conduct.

²3· As you wish to see anything I may have written since your departure,1 will
send you a few speeches, a work called ‘De Oratore,' in three books, and a poem in
three books on my misfortnnes. ²4· lattend carefully to your interests here. Quintus
will be very grateful if yon ean do anything to secure his property in your province.
l shall be glad to hear any particulars about your private life and your son’s studies.
a 5. Appius declares himself resolved to go at once as your successor to Cilicia, and 1
think you had better not delay your return, though others think differently.

26. RS. I have just had your letter about your dispute with the ‘publicani ;' 1
wish you could have avoided it, but Ι approve and will defend your mensures.
