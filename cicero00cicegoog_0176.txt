APPENDIX l. 127

dominions was imposing, the frontier was almost everywhere ill-defined,
and the communicatione insecure. Transalpine Gaul was exposed to
great danger lrorn armed migrations, such as those os the Cimbri and
Teutones in 106 nc, ol Ariovistus and the Suevi in 71, and of the
Helvetii somewhat later. In Spain, the most prosperous theatre ol
Roman colonization, the work of conquest was by no means completed.
The frontier of Macedonia was threatened by northern tribeS, w'ho alter·
wards combined into the sormidable and well-organiaed kingdom of
Dacia. ln the East, Mithridates was not yet subdued; and even the
subsequent defeat of his son-in·law Tigranes only made the Parthian
monarchy os the Arsacidae the more lormidable.

But these dangers were lnfinitely aggravated by three evils, sor which
the Roman govemment was directly or indirectly responsible, the mis·
government ol the provinces; the excessive development os slave culti·
vation in Italy ; and the spread ol piracy in the Mediterranean. Mithri-
dates, Sertorius, and afterwards Catiline, relied in no small degree on
the discontent of the provincials; Spartacus, with an army ol slaves and
gladiatore, ravaged Italy lor nearly three years (73-71 u.c.), and the
pirates, in spite os partial reverses, were long masters ol the Mediterra-
nean, and even threatened the coasts os central Italy.

Seldom had the Roman empire been in greater danger than when
these corsairs kept up a communication between the Spanish insurgeuts
and Mithridates, and encouraged the revolted slaves in Italy. lt was
a most fortunate circumstance lor Rome that, when the insurrection of
Spartacus began, the war with Sertorius had passed its most critical
moment.
