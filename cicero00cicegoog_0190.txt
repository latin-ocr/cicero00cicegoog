position os Pompey and Caesar. The support oi Crassus had perhaps
been already promised at Ravenna.

Pompey 3ηά Crassus were to suc sor the consulship sor 55 rac, 3ηά
so to prevent the election os L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, who might have
proved a formidable enemy. Caesar's government os Gaul was to be
prolonged lor five years, and Pompey and Crassus were to have other
governments lor a like period. The position ol Crassus had always
been a subordinate one, but his wealth and connectione made him a
valuahle ally, and, as he could never aspire to the first place, he might
be of much use as a mediator between his more eminent colleagues.

The measures necessary to carry out these stipulations were only
proposed in the next year, but it is reasonable to suppose that they
were settled now.

The first intimation which Cicero received ol the new compact, seems
to have been from Quintus, with whom Pompey remonstrated in Sar-
dinia on his brother's¹ conduct. This placed Cicero in a position os

great difficulty; he had to choose between submission to the triumvirs,
and an opposition in which most os his allies would be laetious, selfish,
and impracticahle, which would probably be fruitless, and might dismiss
him to a second 3ηά more hopeless exile.

He chose submission; withdrew, apparently, his motion on the Cam-

panian domains², and made some apology to Caesar lor his recent³
opposition.

ξ 5. No part of Cicero’s career seems to have caused him more regret
3ηά vexation; he attempted to justily it by elaborate* excuses and
petulant recrimination ⁶. Personal sear and jealousy no doubt infiuenced
him to a considerable extent, but other considerations should not be lost
sight ol. He had never professed an absolute devotion to the optimates ;
he had more than once argued in favour ol investing Pompey with
extraordinary powers; and the main objectos his political lise had been
to maintain a good understanding betrveen him, the optimate leaderS,
3ηά the equites. Now this seemed impracticahle3 andis the events os
59-58 rac. might detach Cicero from Pompey, what had happened
since his return to Rome was hardly likely to put him on good terms
with the optimates. Even his exile seems to have inspired him with
almost as much resentment towards his irresolute supporters as towards
his more open enemies ⁸. After all, however, he can hardly be acquitted
os rashness in his defiance, and os weakness in his recantation; 3ηά
the next few years form, perhaps, the part oi his career which his
biographer will regard with least pleasure.

lt was, however, a time os great activity ior Cicero as an orator,
