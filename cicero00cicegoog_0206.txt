· Cicero seems to have wished for vigorous war m'th Parthia, to divert
rnen's minds from domestic troubles. From Brundisium he went to
Aeculanum¹ in Samnium on Dec. 6; and thence to an estate² of
L. Pontius in northern Campania, where, probably, he had a conver-
sation³ on political affairs with Pompey, who spolre of civil war as
inevitable. They met again near Formiae, when Pompey again ex·
pressed his apprehensions‚ and spoke of a violent attaclr made upon
himself on Dec. 21 by M. Antonius, one of the new tribunes ⁴.

Cicero asked Atticus his⁶ opinion on the crisis ; denounced⁸ the short·
sightedness which had allowed Caesar to grow so poweriul; expressed
his longing for peace; but said⁷ that if war began he should probably side
with Pompey, rather against his reasonable convictions. He was anxious·
therefore to pay his debts to Caesar before taking‘up arms against him.
At the conclusion of the year he was probably at Tarracina ⁹.

§ab The affairs at Rome in which Cicero had taken most interest
during this year were :—

(1.) The marriage of his daughter. He thought of Tiberius Claudius ¹⁰
Nero for her, but heard that she and Terentia both preferred P. Cor-
nelius Dolabella-a dissipated man who had just divorced his own
wife, but ol good family and agreeable manners ¹¹. This match was
rather embarrassing to Cicero ; lor he had recently been reconciled to
Appius Claudius, and was now doing his best to serve him; whereas
Dolabella accused ¹² Appius of treasonable conduct.

Dolabella had been elected ¹³ one of the ‘quindecimviri saeris faci·
undis,' defeating L. Lentulus Caua, contrary to general expectation.

(a.) The discussion on the honours due to his successes in Cilicia.
The senate voted him ‘supplicationes' early in this year ¹⁴; both the
consuls¹⁶, nith M. Caelius and Curio, supported the grant, but Cato ¹⁶
opposed it; and his artful defence of his conduct naturally excited
Cicero's indignation, when he learned that Cato had supported tlte
claims of Bibulus to a like honour. Caesar¹⁷ seems to have been pleased
at the estrangement of Cicero and Cato.

Cicero seems to have hoped that the vote would be followed by an
acknowledgment of his claims to a triumph. His exploits may hardly
seem to have justified such a hope, but very lilrely they were as great as
those of Lentulus Spinther, who triumphed¹⁸ in 51 nc. Cicero was
