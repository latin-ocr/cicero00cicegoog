APPENDJX rr. 497

The consular power would last from 48 to 44, or from 47 to 43 rac,
according as the year 48 was included or not.

He entered upon his second dictatorship ‘at once,' says Dion Cas·
sius ¹. Tbat is, probably, as soon as he heard of his nomination. Now
Pompey was killed on Sept. 28², and his death might be known in
Rome by the middle of October, from which time Caesar's dictatorship
probably dated. Μ. Antonius was named his master of the horse,
probably by the consul P. Servilius⁸. Caesar seems to have retained
this dictatorship till the end of 47 nc, if we may trust the statements
of Dion Cassius⁴ and Plutarch⁶3 and Mommsen (Corpus Inscr. Lat. r.
pp. 451-453) believes that this dictatorship was conferred for an un-
defined period ‘rei publicae constituendae causa! Coins‚ with the in-
scription ‘Cos tert. Dict. iter.’ support this view. lb. p. 449, and Lange

4. 46 ac. Caesar's third consulship, to which he seems to
have been regulary elected with Lepidus ⁹.

Third dictatorship, decreed to him when the news of the battle of
Thapsus reached Rome. It was for ten years, and probably ‘rei pub
licae constituendae causa! Caesar was named by his colleague Lepidus,
who named himself master of the horse, contrary to precedent ¹⁰.

The Fasti Capitolini place this dictatorship in 45 n.c.; either, as

W. Henzen (Corpus Inscr. Lat. r. pp. 448-449) thinks, because the
greater part of its duration was comprised in that year,—a remark
which applies equally to his second dictatorship with reference to the
years 48 and 47 rr.c.,-as the fourth dictatorship only began late in 45 nc.
at the earliest3 or, as Mommsen (Corpus Inscr. Lat. r. 452) thinks, be-
cause tbe ten years' dictatorship voted to Caesar in 46 was to begin Jan,

45 nc.

5. 45 a. c. Fourth consulship, without a colleague.

The consulship for ten years was decreed to him when the news of
