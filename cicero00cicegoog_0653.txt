1. Iwish you to read this letter careiully. I could not follow Antony at once, sor
want oi transport, and from uncertainty as to the position oi affairs. e. Next dayl
should have visited Pansa, but heard oi his death. lily ioroes were exhausted, and
Antony‚ who had two days’ start, marcbed much [aster than 1 could, aud first halted
at Vada. 3. Ventidius joined him there, and 1 heard that his followers were sager to
decide the contest in Italy. 4 lauticipated thern, however, in occnpying Pollentia,
and the speed oi my march hes rather disconcerted them. Plancus and 1 are confident
that we are amatch sor the enemy: 5. you may trust ns, and hope lor the best, but
do what you can to send ns reinioroements and supplies, that we may resist the guilty
combination oi public enemies.
