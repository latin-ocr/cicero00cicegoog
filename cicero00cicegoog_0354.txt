ol March ¹. Cicero wavered long as to the course ol conduct he should
pursue. He seems never² to have really forgiven himself lor not
making greater exertions to join Pompey, and to have been persuaded
that the only chance, though a slender one, sor the constitution lay in his
triumph ³. He was also much disappointed⁴ by the unremitting energy
ol Caesar's operations, which allowed no time sor negotiations. And,
as has been before remarked ⁶, the notion os living on friendly terme with
Gabinius and others ol his old enemies, seemed intolerable. His disgust⁸
at the violence ol some ol Pompey's adherents was as great as ever, and
he disapproved the project ol starving Rome into submission; but the
licentious⁷ and arrogant conduct ol Caesar’s officers was a more present
annoyance. He was anxious ⁸, too, not to seem merely to depend on
the result os the Spanish campaign, and the representations os Caesar ⁹,
Antony ¹⁰, Caelius ¹¹, and Tullia ¹¹, did not persuade him to be neutral. At

times he even seems to have thought ol raising an insurrection against '

Caesar in Italy, but declined the overtures made him by three cohorts at
Pompeii, as be suspected asnare¹⁸. To the last ¹⁴ be seems to have
hesitated between Joining Pompey and retiring to some neutral place. He
finally embarlred at Caieta ¹⁶ on June 7, and sailed ior Greece. On his
arrival in Pompey’s camp, the state ol affairs he found, aud Cato's re-
proach¹⁸ lor his lolly in going there, must have disconcerted him still
more. He was shocked by the lerocity ¹⁷ ol the language he heard, and
distrusted both the efficiency ol the army and the slrill ol its leaders.
Accordingly ¹⁸ he took no prominent part in operations; or, as
Plutarch ¹⁸ expresses it, Pompey would not entrust him with any
important commission‚ being annoyed at his querulousness. Cicero
revenged himself by sarcasms ²⁰ on Pompey’s tactics and officers.

ξ 8. Caesar, alter the interview with Cicero mentioned above, went to
Rome and attempted to procure the senate’s sanction to negotiations
with Pompey. The senate approved the plan, but no one oliered to act
as envoy ¹¹ ; according to Caesar ²², the threats which Pompey had uttered
on his departure lrom Rome caused this reluctance. Caesar also, in
spite ol the opposition ol L. Metellus, a tribune, forced the doors ol the
· ‘more sacred treasury²³,’ ol which the contents were reserved lor the
emergency ol a Gaulish invasion. He then started lor Spain, according
