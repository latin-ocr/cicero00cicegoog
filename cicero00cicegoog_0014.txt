PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION. ix

Mr. Pretor to his edition of the first book of the letters to
Atticus. My introductions and occasional remarks will show that
I do not altogether agree with Mr. Pretor. As a more general
,comment Ι will here add that every candid reader must allow

ἷ that Cicero was vain, excitable, egotistical, and often wanting in ’

,penetration and foresight as a statesman But it should also,
I think, be remembered that his private life and his provincial
administration were pure; that the state of public affairs threw
extraordinary difficulties in the way of one who, while sincerely
attached, as 1 believe Cicero to have been, to the old constitu-
tion of the Commonwealth, could not be blind to the selfishness
and impracticability of most of its supporters3 that if he was
egotistical and exacting he was also ready to exert himself on
behalf of others-on behalf, for instance, of members of the
defeated party during the government of Caesar; and lastly that
in more than one important political crisis he chose the more
dangerous but honourable side when he might have secured
safety and influence by submission.

Of works which may be less known to English students, 1
wish to mention the edition of all the letters in chronological
order by Billerbeck; that of the letters to Atticus by Boot, with
Latin notes; and those of select letters, with German noteS, by
Hofmann, continued by Andresen, and of Siipfle, especially as
re·edited and altered by Prof. Biickel; also the works of A. W.
Zumpt, Suringar, Drumann, Abeken,'Rein, and the Onomasticon
attached to Orelli's edition. The copious references given by
Drumann and Suringar have been of great service. 1 have care-
fully verified almost all of those which Ι have used, and have
given the sources whence 1 have taken the very few that Ι have
been unable to verify. The edition of select letters with Latin
notes by Matthiae and Muneris, I believe, tolerably well known
to English students. That with German notes by Frey has co-
incided with mine less than the other editions mentioned as to
the letters chosen, and I have therefore found it less useful than
would otherwise have been the case. The first volume of the
Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, published under the superin-
tendence of Theodor Mommsen (Berlin, 1863), will be found
very useful in determining some questions of chronology3 and
M. Boissier's work, ciceron et ses Amis (8vo, Paris, 1865), gives
