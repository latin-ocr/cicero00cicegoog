TO THE FIRST PART.

60 a. c.

515. Pompey renewed his efforts to escape from his unsatisfactory
position, and, in particular, to obtain grants of land for his soldiers,
which he had promised them. With this object L. Flavius, one of the
tribunes brought in an agrarian law, which Cicero revised and supported,
but without success ¹. Meanwhile the discussion in the senate about the
petition of the equites continued, and Cato, much to Cicero's vexation,
not only opposed it, but proposed measures of increased severity against
judicial corruption, aproposal naturally unpleasant to the equites, from
whom one-third of the judges were taken. In both cases the senate
followed Cato’s advice, and the equites, in consequence, regarded the
behaviour of L. Flavius with indifference, even when he ordered the
consul Metellus to be imprisoned for opposing his agrarian law ².

Cicero, disgusted by the frivolity³ of some of the nobles, and the
perversity of others, and much courted by Pompey, inclined to the
latter. Atticus seems to have criticised his conduct ⁴.

About this time Caesar returned from Spain, and began at once to
sue for the consulship, without risking his chance of success by waiting
outside the walls to claim a triumph. Cicero speaks of his popularity ⁶.
He had not yet reached the age required by law for the consulship, but
this seems not to have been urged against‘him⁶; the law had been
already broken in Pompey’s case.

P. Clodius seems to have wished already to become a plebeian, as
a qualification for holding the office of tribune3 he had secured the
services of one of the tribunes of this year, C. Herennius, but others
frequently interposed ⁷.

The optimates⁸ lost one of their wisest leaders in the spring, by the
death of Q. Catulus. Cicero -deeply lamented him ⁹.

Rumours had reached Rome early in the year, of movements in Gaul
which might make an intervention necessary. The Aedui and Sequani
were at war; the Helvetii were meditating a migration westwards‚ and
the senate decreed that the two consuls, after their year of office had
expired, should govern the two Gauiish provinces. Meanwhile envoys
were sent to enquire into the state of affairs, and hinder other states
of Gaui from joining the Helvetii. The senate complimented both
Cicero and Pompey, by regarding their presence as indispensable at
Rome, and did not allow them to serve as envoys ¹⁰. The war rumours
