§16, About the summer, the celebrated combination ol Caesar,
Pompey, and Crassus, usually known as the first triumvirate, was
effected. Cicero seems at first to have thought that he might exercise
great influence over Pompey, and even over Caesm', and he was
evidently flattered by some tempting offers which Balbus made him

in Caesar’s name³; but he feared the reproach ol inconsistency. The
triumvirs succeeded in securing the electiori of Caesar as one consul
sor 59 s.c.; but the optimates, by a prodigal expenditure oi money,
procured the election ol M. Calpurnius Bibulus, a decided member
of their party, as his colleague, instead os L. Lucceius, whom the

sorward again in a more sweeping form, the exemption os Campania
being removed. Α clause⁰ was also appended, binding all senators
and all candidates for any magistracy to take an oath publicly that
they would respect its provisions. The law was to be executed by a
commission oi twenty, of which both Pompey and Crassus were to be
members Cicero scornlully remarks, that P. Clodius was not thought
