Barone the reformation of the Roman Calendar by Julius Caesar
seven months had 29 days each 3 four-March, May, July, and October
-had 313 and February 28, thus making up a year os 355 days. In
alternate years a month was intercalated aller the 23rd os February,
which in the intercalated years had only ²3 days. This Intercalated

’ month had alternately 27 and 28 days. Thus the quadriennIal cycle

would consist oI 1465 days. For 355x4=r420÷55 (two intercalary
months) - 10 (five days twice deducted from February)=1465. This

gave four days too many, and Macrobius (Saturn.r.13) says that in
every third period os eight years only 66 days were inserted, which would
correct the mistake.

Great irregularity, however, prevailed with regard to Intercalation; the
pontifices appear occasionally to have applied it to suit the interests oI
magistrates and governors who were anxious to shorten orto prolong
theIr term of office, and In the year of Cicero's consulshIp the first oI

January oi the old calendar would have corresponded to the sourteenth
oi March oi the Julian. No intercalation seems to have taken place
between that year and 52 nc, and thus the discrepancy of the official
and solar year constantly increased. In 52 nc. the first os January oi
the unrefonned calendar sell really on Νον. 21, 53 nc, but an inter·
calary month os 27 days being inserted aster the agrd oI February ss
usual, the nominal Jan. r os 51 was postponed to Dec, 3, 52.

After this year no Intercalation is found till 47 nc, which had 377
days; its last day fell on Oct rath of the corrected calendar. Then
followed the year of transition, 708 uc. or 46 nc. Its Janr fell on
Oct.13, 7ο7 uc. os the corrected calendar, and Caesar inserted in it,
besides the ordinary intercalary mouth, two extraordinary Intercalary
months numbering ²9 and 28 (1272 respectively, which were inserted
between November and December, 46 nc, and ten days. The trans·
itional year would thus number 445 (1272, ie. 355-5 deducted from
February÷(29÷28÷28÷ (ο) intercalated, and its last day would cor-
respond to the Julian gratos December.

Mommsen (Rbmische Chronologie, pp. 276, 277) explains the change
rather differently. He thiuks that the official year began on March 1
till 45 nc, and that all that Caesar did in 46 was (ι) to insert between
