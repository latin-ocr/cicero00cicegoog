1. Do not suppose I value any one's triticiam more than youra. If γοα must know
why 1 did not send you my recantation, 1 was rather ashamed of it, but the perfidy of
my political associates left me αο choioe. a. You advised meto take my present
course, and l wish by this open avowal to pledge mysell for the future. The jealonsy
of the leaders of the optimates, and their evident exultatlon over any misunderstanding
between Pompey and me, really absolves me from any further obligation to them. 1
will choose more powerful protectore in future. 3. Yon will say, ‘l wish you had done
so long ago! Iacknowledge my folly. Tullia’s dowry exhauste money 1 might have
spent οα traveliing. 1 hope to visit you soon. Your slaves have made themselves
