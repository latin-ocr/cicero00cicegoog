Vir optimus, probably referring to Ci-
cero’s recommendation of him to Atticus.
Cp. ‘mihi quoque. Cicero did not use

have known him,' Atticus wrote. On the
dative ‘mihiss cp. Madv. ²50 a; Ep. ι3ι,

4. Illud † putato. So the best MS.
Boot suggests‘ illud optatnmst' what I so
much wished to hear! Tyrrell suggests
either (ι)ι pata te me,’ ‘suppose that

iu your letter,' i. e. in Atticus' silence as to
any expression of gratitude by Dionysius.

Reate, ‘.’trul The meanin of the
following wo is not very dhar, but
Cicero seems to have placed ln the hands
of Philogenes some money belonging to
himself orto Atticus, with liberty to use
it forsome time. Cp. Ad Att. 5. ι3, ι.
It appears that Atticus bad given Philo
genes bills on some merchants in Asia.

would naturally have waited ιο attend the

there was any rospeet of a triumph: his
entering Rome forehand shewed that he
hardly thought a triumph possible.
