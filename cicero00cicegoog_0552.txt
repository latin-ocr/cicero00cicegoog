purchased with a large sum ¹. The populace was offended by Antony's
vigorous maintenance of order, and he made its hostility a plea for sur-
rounding himself with a guard². The senate sanctioned this step, and
the number of the guard was gradually increased to several thousands.
But Antony was anxious to revive his failing popularity‚ and with that
obJect procured‚ with the aid of his brother Lucius, now tribune, the
enactment of an agrarian³ law. He left Rome in April to superintend
its execution.

The senate, alarmed at the use made of Caesar’s ‘commentariea' seems
to have passed before his departure a decree providing that acommission
should be appointed to inspect Caesar's acts in concert with the consuls
on and after June 1. Cp. Philipp. a. 39, 100; 3. 9, 233 Ad Aa. 16.

Meanwhile Dolabella, who had acted as consul since Caesar's death,
overthrew an altar erected in memory of Caesar by Amatius, and
punished with great severity those who had assembled to worship there;
a service which Cicero praised in extravagant terma ⁴.

his inheritance, and to assume the name of his adoptive father. As he
approached Rome he received promises of support⁶ from the veterana
settled in Campania, but declined thern. Antony had returned to the
capital when Octavius arrived there and claimed Caesar's bequestt.
Antony had already spent the money, but Octavius horrowed from his
friends enough, added to his own resources, to pay a portion at least of
Caesar's legacies to the people‚ and to celebrate some days afterwards
the games of Venus Victrix in honour of Caesar's victory at Pharsalus ⁸.
Owing to the opposition of Antony's friends the enactment of a ‘Lex
Curiata' for-his adoption was delayed ⁹.

Trebonius had already, apparently, left for Asia, and D. Brutus for
Cisalpine Gaul ¹⁰-where, if we judge by results, he was not warmly wel·

But perhaps Appian laces the formation of this guard too ear y, and rt was really
formed after Antony left Rome, from among the veterana settled between Rome and
Capua. See K. Halm,1utr. to Philipp. 1-1, 5 41. ³ Ad Att. 14. 11, 1; Philipp.
