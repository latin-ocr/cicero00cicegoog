62 M. TULLII CICERONIS

bus Cn. Ciceronem appellent; itaque et ludis et gladiatoribus

Nunc est exspectatio comitiorum, in quae omnibus invitis trudit
noster Magnus Auli filium, atque in eo neque auctoritate neque
5gratia pugnat, sed quibus Philippus omnia castella expugnari
posse dicebat [in quae modo asellus onustus auro posset ascen-
dere]; consul autem ille deterioris histrionis similis suscepisse
negotium dicitur et domi divisores habere; quod ego non credo.
Sed senatus consulta duo iam sacta sunt odiosa, quod iu cou-

10 sulem iacta putantur, Catone et Domitio postulante, unum, ut
apud magistratus inquiri liceret, alterum, cuius domi divisores
habitarent, adversus rem publicam. Lurco autem tribunus pl,1s

Deterioris histrionis, either ‘playing
a subordinate part to Pompey,’ or ‘iu-
