512 INTRODUCTION

Antony's outposts had been driven from Claterna, and he afterwards
evacuated Bononia without a battle to concentrate his forces nearer
to Mutina. He commissioned his brother Lucius¹ to watch D. Brutus,
while he himself prepared to resist the advance of Hirtius and Octavius
Antony had a decided superiority² in cavalry, but the country was not
well suited for its action. On receiving news of Pansa's approach he
marched out with his cavalry ¹, two veteran legions, two praetorias
cohorts, and other veterans to intercept him. Hirtius, however, had
already sent out the Martian‘ legion and two praetorian cohorts under
D. Carfulenus to escort Pansa to his camp ; Ser. Galba ⁶, one of Caesar’s
morderem, went on to announce their approach, and when joined by
these troopS, Pansa advanced along the Aemilian way till he encountered
Antony, a little to the east of Forum Gallorum, on April 15th. An
obstinate engagement followed, in which Pansa was severely wounded,
and his forces defeated with great slaughter; but Hirtius fell upon
Antony as he returned to his lines, and inflicted great loss upon him⁸.
Octavius, meanwhile, repulsed an atrack made upon his camp.

Galba reported⁷ this action to Cicero, and despatches frorn the consuls
and from Octavius arrived at Rome about the same tirne with his letter.
Reports had⁸ been previously flying about of a victory of Antony3 others
of usurpation contemplated by Cicero. They met with little credence‚
however3 the truth was known on April 20, and Cicero went up to the
Capitol to thanlr the gods for the victory they had granted ⁰.

Next day the senate ¹⁰ met, and Cornutus read the despatch of the
consuls, which begged that a thanksgiving might be ordered in honour
of their victory. P. Servilius¹¹ argued that their request should be
granted, but did not apply the term ‘hostis' to Antony, nor the term
‘imperatores’ to the consuls. On this Cicero remarked¹' that thanlrs-
givings could only be ordered with propriety in cases when those two
words would be appropriate. He ¹³ proposed that thanksgivings for fifty
days should be offered; that a monument should be erected in honour
of the soldiers who had fallen, and that the promises made to them
should be fulfilled to their surviving relatives The senate adopted these
ι suggestions, and declared Antony a public enemy.

Cicero had been much embarrassed at this time by the personal
jcalousies which prevailed at Rome. Plancus ¹⁴ was evidently discon-
