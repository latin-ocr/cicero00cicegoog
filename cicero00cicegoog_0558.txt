TO THE FIFTH PART. 509

preferred by any other writer, and Cicero¹ says that the instructions
were drawn up in accordance with the advice os Sulpicius,

The envoys set out for Antony's camp3 but as they approached it
Ser. Sulpicius died¹; his colleagues went on, but did not, according to
Cicero, execute their commission with sufficient firmness. During their
absence Hirtius³ set out to take the command of the forces destined to
relieve Mutina, and Cicero again addressed⁴ the senate, to prove that
peace was dangerous, disgracelul, and impossible.

5 13. After the return of Piso and Philippus, who had not been
allowed to confer with D. Brutus ¹, and brought counter proposals frorn
Antony, the senate met to consider those proposals. Cicero was anxious⁸
for an immediate declaration of war against Antony, but the senate
substituted for war the less decided term ‘tumult ⁷,’ greatly to Cicero's
annoyance. He tried to promote his object indirectly, by proposing⁸
that the memory of Ser. Sulpicius should receive honours which had
previously been only granted in the case of envoys who had been killed
in the service of their country, and the senate seems to have adopted his
proposalt

Shortly afterwards a despatch¹⁰ arrived from M. Brutus describing his
successful operations in Macedonia. During the last months of 44 and
the beginning of 43 uc, he had been actively employed, and had made ¹¹
himself master both of Macedonia and of Illyricum. He gained over
some troops which should have followed Dolabella into Asia, and levied
others in Greece; a large sum of money and considerable stores of arms
also fell into his hands. In these operations he was effectively supported
by Cicero’s son Marcus, and the poet Horace held a command in his

army. Q. Hortensius, governor of Macedonia for 44 nc, recognized ,

Brutus as his lawful successor, and P. Vatinius in Illyricum was unable
or unwilling to oppose him; but C. Antonius, brother os Marcus, landed
late in 44 to assume the govemment of Macedonia by virtue os an
appointment already referred to ¹¹. Brutus, however, defeated him, and
wrote, as before mentioned, to announce his successes to the senate.

In the debate which followed, Q. Calenus ¹⁸ recommended that Brutus
should be required to surrender his army and provinces to Vatinius and
C. Antonius ; but Cicero opposed ¹⁴ this strongly, and proposed that the
proceedings ol Brutus should be approved and his authority confirmed.
The senate seems to have adopted this suggestion.
