Graecis mandare cupiebat. Posse arbitror: valet ingenio ; habet
usum; iam pridem in eo genere studii litterarumque versatur;
satis facere immortalitati laudum tuarum mirabiliter cupit.
Habes opinionis meae testimonium, sed tu hoc facilius multos

1. igrieved much for the death of Tullia, and it is hard to console you for a loss
which 1 share: yet a. surely, aller all we have suffered as citizens, you ought to bear
this private loss with firmness. Moreover 3. she had little to live for, considering
the present aspect of things. 4. The sight of many famous ciues lying in ruins lately
made me form a juster estimate of individual life. Think, too, how many eminent
men have died prematnrely in our civil wara. 5. Tullia enjoyed life and honour
as long as life was worth having. Let your philosophy, which has consoled others,

still is conscions of anything, would not have you indulge excessive grief. As amatter
of prudenoe, do not let those in power suspect that you are really bewailing the fall
of the commonwealth. Shew yourself, lastly, aa firm in adversity as you have been
moderate in prosperity.
