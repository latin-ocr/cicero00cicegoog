Cassan had nine veteran legions—eight in Transalpine Gaul, one in
Cisalpine ¹. He had also some German and Gaulish cavalry² and auxi·
liary infantry. Pompey had in Italy two veteran³ legions of doubtful
fidelity, and was authoriaed to levy as many fresh troops as he chose.
It was hoped⁴ that 130,000 men could be raised, but not more than half
that number seem actually to have been brought together. For Pompey
sailed from Brundisium with 20 cohortsl, and had sent on the consuls
with 30⁶; this would give a total of 25,0oo men; Cicero speaks* of
30,0oo as a number reported for Pompey’s whole force. Now Caesar⁸
says that Pompey had lost in Spain and Italy 130 cohorts of Roman
citizens ; and deducting 70 cohorts for 7 legions⁹ in Spain, this state-
ment would make his losses in Italy amount to 60 cohorts, or 30,0oo
men. An'd 30,ooo÷25,ooo or 30‚ooo carried to Epirus, would give a
total of at most 60,ooo mustered in Italy.

In Spain, besides the seven legions just mentioned, a large auxiliary
force ¹⁰ had been raised for Pompey by his officers, Afranius 3ηά
Petreius.

The other provinces were under Pompey’s control, but the forces
stationed there were not very important. Sicily fumished ¹¹ some troops
to Pompey in Epirus, but neither that island nor Sardinia offered much
resistance to Caesar’s officers¹². In Africa, P. Atius Varus levied two
legions for Pompey, and excluded the lawful governor Q. Aelius
Tubero ¹³. Varus could count on effective support from Juba of
Numidia ¹⁴.

In the East, all the dependent princes were inclined to support Pompey,
who had conquered Mithridates and re·organized the Roman empire in
Asia ¹⁶. The Roman forces in that quarter were small and scattered.
After the defeat of Crassus the army of Syria can hardly havecounted
more than ro,ooo regular ¹⁶ infantry, and it does not seem to have been
reinforced before the civil war began. In Cilicia, Cicero as proconsul in
51 nc, complained¹' that he had only ‘nomen duamm legionum
