1. Nothing, even in these troubled times, disquiets me more than the manumission
oi Statius. 1 care less ior the threats oi Clodius, but should be glad oi your presence
and advice. a. The present state ot things is generally odious; no one can be more
unpopular than the soculled popular leaders. Bibulus is the idol ot the populace;
Pompey has lost all hold on its affectione. 1 try to avoid ofleuding our mlers, without
discrediting my previous lise. 3. At all public entertainments people show their
ieelings; this was the case especially when the actor Diphilus attached Pompeyat the
gamcs oi Apollo. The younger Curio had an enthusiastic reception ou the same occa·
sion, and it is said that our masters meditate mensures ol retaliation‚ both against the
equites and against the populace. 4. Clodius threatens me, but Pompey promises
his protection. lam not inclined, however, to accept a place on the Commission ol
Tweuty‚ 5. nor even the post oi legate to Caesar. 1 preter to meet force by force,

quite depcnd on my mcssenger ; otherwise 1 shall substitute other names ior yours and

mine. 1 show proper attention to your uncle.
