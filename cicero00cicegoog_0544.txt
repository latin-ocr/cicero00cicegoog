vinces had been already conceded to Caesar, while that ol' the consular
provinces remained nominally with the senate ¹.

7. Lex Iulia de liberis legationibus-probably extended the tirne sor
which their privileges were enjoyed. Cicero had limited this to a year
by a law proposed in his consulship ¹. Caesar also reduced the number
os recipients ol corn furnished at the public expense from 320,ooo to
150,ooo⁸.

IV. Leges agrariae.

Those of 59 ac. have been already mentioned. Cp. lntr. to Part l,
ξ 17. Α. W. Zumpt thinks‘ that they remained legally valid, and might
be put into operation whenever there was money in the treasury to buy
land ; and that as dictator Caesar actually did revive the laws ol his con·
sulship with only two alterations, viz.

1. That their operation was extended to lands out of Italyt

a. That ‘vigintiviri¹ were no longer appointed to superintend their
execution, which was now entrusted to Caesar's legates ⁶.

In any case lands were assigned to veterana in various parts os Italyl
“ in 46 rac. Such lands had probably either been previously unoccupied,
or recently confiscated, or were purchased. The towns where such sol-
diers were settled were not necessarily called ‘coloniae' and the landa
assigned were for the most part not contiguous. None but soldiers
received lands in ltatyt

V. Laws of Caesar as ‘consul rv, dictator rv’ (? see pp. 497-8) 45 rac.

1. Increase os the senate to 900 ⁹.

a. Creation ol new patrician familias ¹⁰.

3.1ncrease of the ‘triumviri monetales' to 4. Connected perhaps
with a permission granted to Caesar to stamp coin with his name ¹¹.

4. Addition ofa third class, called iuliani, to the Luperci ¹².

5. Continuation of distribution of lands begun 46 n. c.¹⁸

6. Increase ol the number of quaestors to 40 ,· of praetors, first to 14
and then to 163 of aediles to 6¹⁴.

7. Lex Iulia municipalis. This appears to have comprised firstly,
regulations as to the distribution of corn at the public expense at Rome;
secondly‚ police regulations especially relating to the traffic in the streets
