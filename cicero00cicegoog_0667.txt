who failed, however, to command the respectos his men, and perished
in a mutiny which perhaps was caused hy the intrigues ol Q. Caecilius
Bassus, who then took the command ol his forces, and probably in·
creased them¹. Caesar, however, sent against Bassus three legions
under the command ol L. Statius Murcus, who was supported by an
equal force under Q. Marcius Crispus, governor ol Bithynia. On the
arrival ol Cassius in Syria, both the opposing armies placed themselves
under his orders, and A. Allienus, who at Dolabella's command raised
lour legions in Egypt and led them into Syria, was alarmed by the
superiority ol Cassius' forces, and submitted to him’. Cassius subse-

quently besieged Dolabella at Laodicea ⁸, and Dolabella killed himself
when Cassius’ soldiers entered the place.

ιι. M. Antonius seems to have had no regular force at his disposal
vill,- alter the execution ol Amatius, the senate empowered him to raise
soldiers ior his protection ⁴. Alterwards, early in June, apparently, he
seems to have procured a decree of the senate⁶ assigning to himself
Macedonia, and to Dolabella Syria, with the command against the
Parthians. Six legions had been assembled by Caesar in Macedonia
sor the war, which would naturally have been commanded by Dolabella;
but rumours ol threatening movements among the Getae enabled
Antony to persuade the senate to detain them all in Macedonia except
onel, which probably lollowed Dolabella Finally, in July, apparently,
Antony obtained Cisalpine Gaul by a vote os the centuries in exchange
lor Macedonia, Octavian supporting his claims⁷. Subsequently Antony
brought over ldur or five legions⁸ from Macedonia into Italy, but two
