Roas, Jurvu on Juuv, (t) 61 nc. (693 nuc.)

s. Iwill explain toyou my comparative inactivity oi late, aud the result oi Clodius’
trial. As long as there was any hope oi success, l exerted myseli to the uttermost;
a. but when Hortensius had made his iatul concessiou as to the appoiutmeut oi the
judges, 1 withdrew, not sharing his confidence as to the result. 3. Yet, even aiter the
challenge oi the judgas, which went very much iu favour oi the accused, 4 iu all the
earlier stages nithe trial everything looked promising ior the prosecutiou; and, when
l appeared to give evidence, 1 had a most flatteriug reception irom the judges 5. How·
ever, bribery and corruption oi the most atrocious kind secured a slight majority ior uu
scquittal. 6. This has been a heavy blow to the commouwealth, 7. but i am glad to
say that bad citizens do not exult so much iu their victory as one might have expected
8. 1 have exerted myseli to reassure the senate and all well-disposed citizens, and have
attached the corrupt judges, the consul Piso, and Clodius 9. 1 said, on May 15, that
the acquittal oi Clodius only reserved him ior heavier punishment, aud (ιο.) completely
silenced himin a lively altercatiou which followed my speech. 11. On the whole, 1
think my position is as good as ever iu the regard oi the welldisposed, while my un·
popularity with the populace has dimiuished, und 1 evidently enjoy Pompey's esteem
in a high degree. 12. We look ionvard with much interest to the consular comitia.
Pompey is actively supporting Afranius, aud systematic corruption is ieared. Special
mensures are being taken against it 13. The electiou oi Afranius would throw dis·
credit ou the consulship. 14. I regret that you will not attend Quintus in Asia, 15. sm
content with the inscriptions iu your Amaltheum, 16. sud have written to thunk C.
Antonius ior his services to you 17. I will attend to the affairs oi Cincius. 18. Let
me know all about your Amaltheum.
