of theold municipia and praefecturae. The rights of the new municipia
were settled by ‘leges municipales,' of which the Lex Rubria, passed in
49 ac. (cp. p. 493), and the Lex Iulia municipalis, passed in 45 nc.
(cp. p. 495), were among the most important. All the new municipia
had some rights oi local self-govemment. Cp. Marquardt 1. 62-67;

‘Roman citizens not belonging by extraction to the city of Rome.'

afterwards formed, consisting os the settlements of veterans made in
different parts of Italy by Sulla—an example afterwards imitated by the
dictator Caesar aud by Augustus These did not, it is true, form in all
cases new political communities; but Praeneste is spoken of by Cicero
as a colony (In Cat. r. 3, 8), and so is Capua (Pro Sest. 43 Philipp. 2.
40), where a considerable number of veterans and of indigent Roman
citizens was settled under Caesar's agrarian law os 59 a. c. (cp. supr.
pp. 16-17; 74); Casilinum also is called a colony (Philipp. l. c. Cp.

IV. Α new class of ‘ Latini’ came into existence in the year 89 a. c.,
when a law of the consul, Cn. Pompeius Strabo, raised several towns of
the Transpadani to that position. The same privilege was extended to
other towns subsequently, eg. to Novum Comum, where Caesar estab
lished or augmented a colony not consisting oi Latius by birth or
Romans. Such communities could of course onlybecalled Latin colonies

V. Cicero (Pro Sest. 14, 3²) speaks of ‘coloniae,' municipia,' and
‘praefecturae’ as forming three classes of towns in Italy in his time.
ln speaking of ‘ coloniae,' he must refer to colonies of Roman citizens,
but perhaps also, less properly, to Latin colonies ¹. When it is his
object to speak accurately he shows a clear appreciation of the dis·
tinction between Latin colonies and municipia-or rather of the change
effected in the condition oi Latin colonies by the enactment of the ‘Lex
Iulia' (cp. Philipp. 13. 8, 18).

VI. Of the towns which had originally been ‘praefecturae' Cicero
speaks of Reate aud Atina as still bearing that name (ln Cat. 3. 2, 53
Pro Plane. 8, 19). Arpinum, which had been a ‘praefectura' he calls
‘municipium' (supr. pp. 456-457); Puteoli and Cumae had undergone

¹ 1 now doubt whether any of the older Latin colonies, that is, of those founded
before the enattmeut of the ‘ lex lulia’ were still called colonies, even in popular
language‚ after the enactmeut of that law. The language of Cicero as to andisium
is hardly decisive (Ad An. 4 1, 4). Asconius, it is true (Iu Pisonian. 3. rao), wouders
at Cicero's calling Placentia a municipium, which had been a Latin colony.
