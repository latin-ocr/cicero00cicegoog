close of the year, especially on account of the departure of Atticus from
Rome ¹.

Of the rnen referred to in his letters of this date, the most important,
besides those already mentioned, were hl. Terentius Varro and Cioem's
son-in-law, C. Piso.

The former, an eminent antiquary, will be often mentioned. He had
been on good terms with Cicem', who looked for his support against
Clodius, but afterwards suspected him of duplicity⁸, and only partially
regained confidence in him ⁴.

C. Calpurnius Piso, a connection of Cioem’s enemy, the consul L.
Piso, sbowed the greatest devotion to his father-inhw, both by trying to
conciliate the oonsul, his hinsman ⁸, and by declining to go into a pro-
vince as quaestor, in order that he might watch over Cicem's interests at
Rome ⁸. He seems to have died soon after Cicero’s return from exile'.
Cicero always speaks of him in the highest tenus!

§23. The consul Lentulus proposed Cicero's recall on the 1st of

January. He was supported by Pompey and by L. Cotta, and a decree
would have passed on that very day, but that Sex. Atilius Serranus, one
of the tribunes demanded a night for considentium. The decree seems
afterwards to have been regarded as legally passed¹·. Various difficulties
prevented a renewal of the discussion till Jan. 23, when Cicero's friends
brought a bill for his recall before the popular assembly. Clodius, how·
ever, interfered with his armed rabble, and Q. Cicero was grievously
hurt¹¹. No further steps seem to have been taken in Cicero's behalf
for some months; in July, Clodius appears still to hawe been master
of the streets of Rome ¹².

The senate subsequently passed a series of decrees in favour of Cicero,
but their precise number and dates are not easy to determine. Perhaps
three may be distinguished.

1. Summoning the Italiam to Rome for Cicero’s protection ; thanking
the allies for attentioris shown him, and recommending his safety to
officials in the provinces and to foreign princes ¹⁸. This was passed,
apparently, in the ‘monument of Marius¹⁴,' and was followed by a great
demonstration at the theatra in honour of Cicero ¹⁸.

2. Declaring that Cicero’s counsels bad saved the state, and, perhaps,
