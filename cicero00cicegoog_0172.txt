NOTE E. On theMeam'ng ostie words ‘Impen'rmr' and ‘Imperaron'

¹ Imperium ’ differed from ‘potestas' both in the powers which it comprised, and in
the fact that it could only be regularly granted bys distinct vote of the people (cp.
Paul. Diae. Exerpt. p. 50), the ‘lex curiata de imperio '-which, however, does not
seem in Cicero’s time to have been universally regarded asnecessary: cp. Ep. 29, 25,
note. In the time of the kings, ‘imperium’ seems to have comprised military, judicial,
and administrativa prerogativae, and to bave passed into the hands of the first consuls,
subject only to two limitations; that it was made annual, aud divided between two
persons. According to Mommsen (Staatsrecht 1. 48-50), ‘potestas' when the word is
not used pleonastioally (as by Cicero, In Verr. Act. 1. 13, 37), nor as including ‘im-
perium' expresses merely a negative notion, that of official power without ‘imperium'
‘Imperium’ he explains as describiug the power of those magistrates on whom the
supreme authority formerly possessed by the kings had devolved. The view of Lange
(Rom. Alt 1. 232-241; 264-269)-that ‘potestas’ described the patriarchal powers
of the king or magistrate, considered as a ‘ paterfamilias: on a great scale, while
‘ imperium’ described the powers conveyed to him by the voluntary act of a body of
independent ‘patres familias '-is ingenious and plausible, but hardly demonstrable.

The constitutional history of Rome is, to a great extent,a history of the further
limitation of the ‘imperium ' by subdivision, by ‹iirect legislation, and by the increas-
ing strictness of the senate's control over public officers The institution of the
praetorship in 366 nc. was an important step in this direction. ‘Iuris dictio' was
apparently regarded as an exercise of the ‘imperium ' (see p. rar),and was theutrans·
ferred from the consuls to the praetor.

Before eonsidering the meanings which the word ‘imperium’ bore in Cicero's time,
it will be convenient to point out an important change which had taken place in the
system of Roman administration. ’

For many years the foreign provinces of Rome were govemed by praetors during
their year of office, unless a formidable war happened to be going on in or near to any
of them, in which case the conduct of the war was often entrusted to a consul. But a
change was made during the later years of the commonwealth's existence, owing to the
gradual increase in the number of the provinces. and to the greater demand for the
services of the praetors at Rome. These two causes made it necessary to entrust the
government of provinces often to proconsuls or propraetors; and, after Sulla had or·
ganized six permanent criminal courts, these, together with the two civil courts,
required the superintendenoe of all the praetors, though their number was at that time
inermsed to eight. Cp. Smith, Dict. of Antiq. sub voce. ‘iudex.' ‘praetor'

They might. however, be employed on military service in case of extreme need; and
Q. Metellus Celer was so employed in 63 nc. Cp. Ep. 4, notes aad references.

At some time during Cicero’s life it besam usual for the consuls also to remain in
Italy during their year of office. Mommsen thinks that tbis change dated from the
legislation of Sulla, but allows that there were many exceptione during the following
twenty years. Rom. Hist. 3. 3673 Rechtsfrsge 9-11; 29·34. Others have fixed on
the year 74 s. c. as that with which the new system begau; A. W. Zumpt thinks that
it dsoed from 59 uc. Cp. Studia Romana, pp. 72, 73.
