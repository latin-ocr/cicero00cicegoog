INTRODUCTION.

ξ 1. M. Tuccius Crcrao was born at Arpinum Jan. 3, 106 a.c.¹ His
father bore the same name, and was a Roman lrnight of considerable
lauded property; his mother, Helvia, is said’ to have belonged toa
good family. Cicero calls the poet Archias, who went to Rome in
102⁸, one of his earliest teachers⁴; and hence it‘ is probable that the
family removed to Rome about that time.

Both the greatest orators of the time-L. Crassus and M. Antonius-
took an interest in Cicero's education⁵3 and his uncle Lucius accom-
panied Antonius, who received about this time a commission to suppress
piracy‚ to the East ⁵.

Afrer completing his earlier studies⁷ Cicero began to attend the lessons
of a Latin rhetorician‚ L. Plotius for which, however, he afterwards sub·
stituted those of Greek teachersl. At the age of seventeen he often
listened to the answers given on points of law by Q. Mucius Scaevola,
the augur⁹3 but his legal education was interrupted by the Social War,
in which he¹⁰ served under the consul Cn. Pompeius Strabo, and Scaevola
died about this time. Cicero, however, resumed his studies under another
Scaevola, cousin of his late teacher, and pontifex maximus. Among his
teachers in philosophy were the Academic Philo and the Stoic Diodotus;
in rhetoric, Apollonius, surnamed Molon, of Rhodes who was then at
Rome, and whose precepts were illustrated by the speeches of the elo·
quent tribune P. Sulpicius ¹¹.
