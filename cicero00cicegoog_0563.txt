commissioned¹ him to act against Dolabella, whom he besieged in
Laodicea A strict navat blockade of the same plaoe was maintained
by Patiscus, Turullius, and C. Cassius, a quaestor. Some of the gates
were subsequently betrayed to Cassius, and Dolabella killed himself.
Cassius, after occupying the place, marched towards Egypt, but was
recalled by a letter from Brutus, and went to meet him in the province
of Asia’.'

words

When Octavius had teleneu the consulship, he ascended to the Capitol
to make the usual vows and sacrifices3 paid Caesar's bequests to the
people; thanked the senate for releasing him from the restrictiou of
the ‘Leges Annales' and procured the enactment of a ‘Iex Curiata''
to sanction his adoption. Other laws of importance followed ; one
remowing the outlawry of Dolabella, and another* directing that an
enquiry should be made about the murder of Caesar, and fixing a
punishment for the principals and accomplices in it. Under this law,

condemned in their absence to exile and confiscation, which of course
implied the loss of commands and provinces ⁸.

Lepidus. He signitied his approval, and the reversal was carried ⁴.
Meanwhile Antony and lepidus, leaving L. Varius Cotyla in charge
of Gaul, marched into ltaly' at the head of a large army, and met
Octavium near Bononia, where, in an island⁸ formed either by the
Lavinius or the Rhenus, the three generals met to protide for the
government of the western part of the empire, for the prosecution of
the war with Brutus and Cassius, for the removal of their own most
formidable enemies, and for the reward of their soldiers by confiscation ⁵.
Their measures were agreed upon by about the end of October¹⁰, and
a despatch ¹¹ was at once sent off to Rome bidding the consul Pedius
to put to death at once serenteen of the proscribed‚ including Cicero.
According to some accounts¹², Octavius had struggled long before sacri-
ficing him to Antony. A terrible agitation followed the arrival of the
