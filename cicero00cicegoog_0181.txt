The lex Porcia, enacted, probably, in the year 197 nc, provided that
no Roman citizen should be scourged or put to death by the sentence
osa magistrate. Cp. Livy 10. 93 Sall Cat 51; Cic pro Rah. 4, ra.
subsequently, a lex Sempronia (C. Gracchi) provided that no eom·
missions should be appointed, without the consent os the people, for
trying cases in which the ‘caput' oi a Roman citizen was endangered.
Cp. Pro Rab. l. c., and the quotation from Ahrens in Orelli's Index
Legum, Onomast. vol. 3.

Neither oi these laws, os course, would interiere with the old capital
prosecutions sor ‘perduellio' before the people assembled in the comitia
centuriata; but such prosecutions were very rare in the later years ol the
Commonwealth.

It is clear that the execution ol Lentulus and his accomplices was in
direct violation os the Porcian law, and ol others probably, unless the
decree by which the senate invested the consuls with extraordinary
powers (viderent consules nequid detrimenti respublica caperet) deprived
those who should subsequently be guilty ol seditious practices of their
rights as citizens. Cicero argues that such was the legal effect of that
decree, and that Lentulus and his associates were outlaws. Cp. ln Cat
1. 11, 28 ; 4. 5, 10; Pro Rab. 7·¹¹· And Sallust (Cat 29) says oi the
effect ol that decree, ‘ea potestas per senatum more Romano magis-
tratibus maxima permittitur . . ‚coercere omnt'bus modii socios atque
cives! These words, however, do not essert the strict legality of punish-
ments inflicted by virtue os the decree, and Sallust makes Caesar (cap.
51) plead energetically that Lentulus could not be put to death hythe
senate’s order. The senate does not seem to have had the power of
disfranchising Roman citizens (cp. In Verr. a Act. 1, 5, 13); according
to the author os the speech ‘De Domo¹ (29, 30), no one could be
