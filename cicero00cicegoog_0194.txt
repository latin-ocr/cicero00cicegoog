recovered. She died next year.

§p The events ol the war in Gaul were important. The campaign
opened with the destruction ol the Usipetes and Tencteri, who had
crossed the Rhine, and were attached rather² treacherously by Caesar.
He was anxious to deepen the impression thus made, threw a bridge
over the Rhine, and spent some days on its right bank with the inten-
tion oi striking terror into the population. Alterwards he received the
submission ol the Morini, and made his first expedition² into Britain,
which, however, produced no decisive results ⁴.

In Syria, Gabinius, alter restoring Ptolemy XII at Alexandria, had
returned to his province, and was preparing ior war with Parthia A
family quarrel in the Arsacid dynasty gave him a pretext for interierence.
Phraates, king os Parthia, had been murdered by his sons Mithridates
aud Orodes 3 and, when the latter seemed likely to secure the throne,
Mithridates tled tol Gabinius, who, however, could not assist him at
once, as his attention was diverted by the affairs⁸ oi Egypt

§ra The consuls sor this year were 1. Domitius Ahenobarbus and
Appius Claudius Pulcher. The iormer was one os the most obstinate
and determined os the optimates; the latter an incapable and covetous
man ol no definite political convictions. The extraordinary commands,
however, now held by the triumvirs, made it the less important who held
· the ordinary political offices.

Cicero seems still to have acquiesced completely in the government oi
the triumvirs. Among his forensic speeches, ol which he delivered an
unusual number in this year, we read of one⁷ in July on behali oi
C. Messius, now a legate oi Caesar; oi one⁸, delivered somewhat later,
for Vatinius, whom Cicero had denounced so bitterly at the time oi
Sestius' trial; and even ol one· delivered iu the autumn lor Gabinius,
whom he had considered his worst enemy.

Gabinius had been accused somewhat earlier by L. Lentulus, and
acquitted by abare majority, to the great disgust ol Cicero, who bore
testimony¹⁰ against him. Gabinius had attached Cicero ¹¹ violently in the
senate, but on his trial expressed a wish sor reconciliation. The speech
‘Pro Rabirio Postumo,' now extant, was delivered on a trial which grew
out os that ol Gabinius, whose unjust gains Rabirius was accused oi
sharing.
