lar. 61.] AD ATTICUM IX. 7. 341

thqt 1 may lpind you at Rome on my arrival there, and have the benerit oI your support
an counse

CAESAR IMP. S. D. CICERONI IMP.

Cum Furnium nostrum tantum vidissem, neque loqui neque
audire meo commodo potuissem, properarem atque essem in
itinere, praemissis iam legionibus, praeterire tamen non potui,
quin et scriberem ad te et illum mitterem gratiasque agerem, etsi
hoc et ieci saepe et saepius mihi facturus videor: ita de mes
mereris. Imprimis a te peto, quoniam confido me celeriter ad
urbem venturum, ut te ibi videam, ut tuo consili0, gratia, digni·
tate, ope omnium rerum uti possim. Ad propositum revertar:
festinationi meae brevitatique litterarum ignosces; reliqua ex
Furnio cognosces. ιο

61. To Atticus (Ad Att. lx. 7).

Fortuita, Marcu 13, 49 ac. (705 auc.)

ι. Ivras cheered to some extent by your letter, but have long ceased to hope Ior
a happy issue from onr troubles a. Iam glad to learn that Peducaeus approves my
conduct I will Iollow your advice and stay at Formiae till Caesar has gone ro
Rome. 3. Ihad already asked Caesar to allow me to be neutral, as you suggest3
bnt is he reluses my request, 1 Icar that Pompey wIll hardly be pleased at my pro-
posing negotiation. 4 For he intends to reduce Italy to obedience hy famine,

devastation, and exactione. 1 sear Caesar’s adherente will imitate him, and my
obligations to Pompey will prevent my remaining in Italy. 5. lgIve up my hopes
of a triumph quite willingly, and stay quietly in this neighbourhood till l can sail to
onn Pompey. Iregard his probable tactica with abhorreuce, bnt anythiug is better
than witnessing what Caesar’s friends will probably do in Italy. 6. I am glad that
good citizens approve my conduct, and will enquire about Lentulus. 7. Write what
you can, even it you have little to say.
