ξ 8. Important events had happened during his absence. Antonyhad
procured early in the summer¹ a vote ol the people sanctioning an
exchange ol provinces between him and D. Brutus, and empowering him
to transport the anny ol Macedonia to Cisalpine Gaul. He owed his
success in this manoeuvre to the co-operation ol Octavius, with whom
lte had effected a temporary‘reconciliation. An enactment¹ presently
followed, extending the duration of proconsular govemments lrom two
years to six. This was in direct violation ol a law of Caesar.

Ι Notice was also given³ ol mensures introducing a more popular
clement into tbe courts oi lay, and granting the privilege ol appeal
to the people to criminals convicted ol riot or treason l‘vis’ or

ξ 9. Οιι September 1⁴tbe senate was convokedto consider the propriety
oi addinga day to the public thanlrsgivings‚ in honour ol Caesar. Cicero
sent an excuse to Antony sor his absence, but Antony spoke ol him with
much violence. On the next day Cicero addressed the senate, Antony
being absent. His speech, the first Philippic‚ vas a criticism ol Antony's
policy, free, however, from personal hostility. He complained⁵ espe-
cially ol the promulgation ol measures directly violating laws of Caesar,
and ol the use⁶ made of Caesar's papers; artfully mixed praise and cen·

¹ sure⁷ ol the presiding consul Dolabella; spoke ol Hirtius⁸ with much
regard; and varned’ Antony what his late would probably be ii he
persisted in his actual course. Antony replied ¹⁰ on September 19 with
a violent attack on Cicero's whole career, and leit Rome¹¹ ou October 9
lor Brundisium, where three or four legions ol the army ol Macedonia
had landed. They had been tampered with, probably, by agents ol
Octavius, and received Antony badly. The good understanding between
Antony and Octavius had not lasted long ; and Antony had charged ¹²
Octavius with plotting his assassination. Having punished¹⁸ some ol
the mutinous soldiers, Antony set out ior Rome attended by the fifth
legion ¹⁴ (‘ Alaudae '). The legions of Macedonia were to proceed along
the coast road to Cisalpine Gaul.

is not quite correctly described in the text It ia very doubtful ii any equivalent lor
the province of Cisalpine Gaul was offered to D. Brutus, and Antony was apparently
to have one ol the dutrwts ol Transalplne, as well as Cisalpine Gaul ς cp. Appendlx

preceded that giving M.Autonms the Galltc provinces whrcb he desired. 0. E. Schmidt,

a special one, only intended to apply to the case ol Antony and Dolabella, and the
passages just quoted lrom {¹¹² Philippica suppopt this view. τ ³ Ib. r. ⁸⁸⁸¹¹d 9.
