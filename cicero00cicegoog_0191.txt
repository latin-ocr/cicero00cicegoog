142 INTRODUCYION

especially in the law courts ; and the speeches which have been pre·
served, numerous as they are, give no adequate notion of his exertions.

The speech in defence of M. Caelius Rufus, accused of sedition and
of attempted poisoning, seems to belong to this spring or summer, but
it is not easy to fix its precise date. It was successful, and seems to
have led to a lasting friendship between Cicero and his client. Intimacy
with Catiline had been made a charge against Caelius, and, in replying
to it, Cicero introduced a portrait of Catiline more favourable than those
with which we are most familiar ¹.

ξ 6. About this time Cicero argued² in the senate in favour ofa grant
of money for the pay of Caesar's troops, and ol his being allowed to
name ten legates. Shortly afterwards he had to attest his recantation by
a still more decided step.

A discussion took place in the senate about the assignation of pro·
vinces to the consuls of 55 rac, provision for which was generally
made belorehand. Some proposed that either Cisalpine or Transalpine
Gaul should be one, which of course would imply the withdrawal of one
province from Caesar. Cicero, however, notwithstanding the remon-
strances of some οἱ* the optimates, and of the consul* Philippus, opposed
the suggestion successfully, saying that it was essential that Piso and
Gabinius⁶ should be recalled as soon as possible, and that difficulties
would arise if one of Caesar's provinces were assigned to one of the
consuls⁸ for 55. He also extolled the successes of Caesar ⁷, and attached
the inconsistency of those optimates who questioned the validity of the
Julian laws while defending that of the Clodian ⁸. In a letter⁹ written to
P. Lentulus Spinther about this time, Cicero describes the debate as
though he had taken no prominent part in it himself.

Either in the summer or autumn he pleaded for the rights of citizen·
ship of L. Cornelius Balbus which had been conferred by Pompey in
Spain. The validity of the act depended on strictly legal points, but the
trial enabled Cicero to show his devotion to Pompey by panegyric ¹⁰.

The confidence which Pompey derived from the renewal of his alliance
with Caesar seems to have removed his anxiety to be employed in Egypt;
and he authorized Cicero to write to Lentulus, in terms ¹¹ which must be
considered as a cautious encouragement to intervention.

During the last few months ol the year, little of importance happened
at Rome. Cicero suffered a severe loss in the death ¹² of L. Lentulus
Niger, flamen of Mars, for whom he had felt much esteem. He was
also much annoyed by the humiliating position to which he had been
