152 INTRODUCTION

Cyprus, Isauria, Lycaonia, and three other districts, north ol Taurus, ol
which the capitals appear to have been Cibyra, Synnada, and Apamea ¹.
The senate recommended Ariobarzanes¹ of Cappadocia to his protection.

He succeeded Appius Claudius Pulcher, brother os P. Clodius, and
had to complain ol much discourtesy, especially of the unwillingness⁸
ol Appius to grant him a meeting. Cicero had little taste sor his new
functions, especially as the forces allotted lor the delence of his province
seemed inadequate⁴, and a Parthian invasion was not improbable. He
had, however, able officers among his legates 3 his brother Quintus,
C. Pomptinus, M. Anneius, and L. Tullius· are mentioned. As quaestor
he had L. Mescinius Rufus⁸, afterwards succeeded by C. Caelius Caldus⁷.
Cicero’s son and nephew also accompanied him with their tutor
Dionysius ⁸.

ξ 18. He started from avilla near Pompeii on May ro, and passing
through Beneventum and Venusia spent three days at Tarentum, where
he had a conversation with Pompey’. He then went to Brundisium,
where he met some officers ol Appius ¹⁰. He was very anxious that tbe
force in Cilicia should not be diminished by disbandment‚ and wrote to
Appius on the subject. Alter adetention ol some days at Brundisium,
owing to ill health and the non-arrival ol his legate Pomptinus ¹¹, he
reached Actium June 14, and Athens June 24, where he spent ten days δ’.
Thence he sailed by Gyarus, Scyrus, and Delos to Ephesus ¹³, where he
arrived July 22. During the earlier partos the voyage he had suffered
considerably srorn stormy weather, for which the light Rhodian vessel on
which he sailed was ill suited. He had been able when at Athens to do
aservice ¹⁴ to the heads ol the Epicurean school there by writing to
C. Memmius, then an exile at Mytilene.

About the same time an affair connected with Milo's exile gave Cicero
much annoyance. Milo’s property had been sold lor the benefit of his
creditors, and Philotimus,a lreedman of Terentia, was one ol the pur·
chasers. Cicero heard that Milo was offended at this ; but represented
that he had acted on good advice lor the benefit ol Milo, and would
gladly get out ol the business ¹⁵.

519. Alter a stay os three days at Ephesus, Cicero reached Tralles
July 27, and there received a despatch from his predecessor ¹⁶. He then
entered his province, and arrived at Laodicea 011Π July 31. He found
the country in a deplorable state, owing to the exactions ol Appius¹⁸, and
