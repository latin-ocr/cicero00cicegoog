a younger brother os Marcus, were defeated in illyricum by M. Oc-
tavius and L. Scribonius Libo. Antonius was made prisoner ¹.

Pompey, in the meantime²‚ was collecting and organising a large force
in Epirus and Macedonia. A considerable fleet gave him the command
ol the Adriatic. He wintered at Thessalonica ³.

§ 10. Cicero spent the first monthsol this year in the camp ol Pompey.
While there he received letters from Caelius* and Dolabella ⁶. The first
expressedregret lor having taken Caesar's side3 the last begged Cicero
to return to Italy now that he had seen how small were Pompey’s chances
ol success. During the battle ol Pharsalus Cicero was at Dyrrhachium ⁸,
in bad health. Labienus brought the news ol the deleat there ⁷, and the
partisans ol Pompey crossed over to Corcyra, where, probably ⁸, Cato
asked Cicero, as the senior consular present, to take the command.
Cicero declined, and was threatened with death by Cn. Pompeius the
younger. Cato, however, protected him, and Cicero sailed to Brundisium,
where he remained lor some time ⁹.

He seems to have written few letters from Epirus, and was perhaps
afraid ¹⁰ to write lreely. Such as we have show ¹¹ much anxiety¹² lor
his wile, who appears to have been embarrassed by want of money,
which Cicero could not understand; regret¹⁸ lor his mistalre in leaving
Italy; and despondency ¹⁴ at his party's prospects. He advanced con-
siderable¹⁶ sums to Pompey. Subsequent letters ¹⁰ illustrate still more
strongly the discontent and melancholy which then possessed him.
From the taunts of Antony it seems that Cicero’s petulance and
gloom gave general offence¹⁷. He does not comment in detail on the
events ol the war, but refers in one place ¹⁸ to the loolish confidence
inspired by Caesar’s deleat near Dyrrhachium.

§ 11. In the winter Caesar had succeeded in conveying seven
legions to Epirus, and was afterwards joined by Antony with four
more, all, however, much thinned by battles, long marches, and unhealthy
quartem. He attempted to blockade Pompey’s lines at Petra, near
Dyrrhachium, but a serious reverse forced him to give up this plan, and
he marched into the interior, where he was joined by Cn. Domitius
Calvinus, whom he had dctached into Macedonia. Pompey also
formed a junction with his father-inlaw, Scipio, whom he had recalled
