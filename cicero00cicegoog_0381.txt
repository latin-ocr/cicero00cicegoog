me venit, occulta via currens ad Lentulum consulem, missu
Caesaris, cum litteris, curn mandatis, curn promissione provin-
ciae, Romam ut redeat, cui persuaderi posse non arbitror, nisi
erit conventus. Idem aiebat nihil malle Caesarem, quam ut
sPompeium adsequeretur-id credo-et rediret in gratiam: id
non credo et metuo ne omnis haec clementia ad † unam illam
crudelitatem colligatur. Balbus quidem maior ad me scribit
nihil malle Caesarem quam principe Pompeio sine metu vivere:
tu puto haee credis. Sed, curn haec scribebam v. Kalend, Pom-
ro peius iam Brundisium venisse poterat: expeditus enirn ante-
cesserat legiones xl. Kal. Luceria. Sed hoc τέρας horribili vigi-
lantia, celeritate, diligentia est. Plane quid futurum sit nescio

1. Iam not so much agitated as you suppose, and spend all my time in studying
the pertrait ol a statesman drawn in my work on the Commonwealth. a. Pompey is
not such a man: he only cares ior sovereignty, and intends to assail Italy with the
forces ol the East, and to rule like Sulla. Il he and Caesar had desired it, a pesoelul
settlement was quite possible. 3. 1 give you, as you requested, my views ol the
future. We neutrals bave to dread the vengeauce ol both parties. 4. Italy will next
summer be the scene ol s ruinous struggle, and 1 see no topic ol consolation.
5. Caesar is well satisfied with me, and is anxious to persuade the eousul Lentulus
to stay in Italy. ὁ. 1 send you two hasty letters from Pompey, with my replies.
