1. 1 write hastily, while actually on the road. a. 1 arrived in this miserable
province on the last day oi last month, and hear nothing bnt complaints os exactiori,
and find many traces oi my predecessor's oppression. 3. The unhappy communitiea
are, however, relieved by the moderatiori and seli-control which 1 praetise myseli
and enioroe upon my officers, and my popularity exeeeds all belief. 4. Appius has
retired to the most remote part oi the province. No authentia news about the Par·
thians. Bibulus still delays to enter his province. Iam hastening to my camp.
