nv. 3o.] AD FAMILIARES ΙΙ. 6. 223

as Scripta iam epistola superiore accepi tuas litteras de publicanis,
in quibus aequitatem tuam non potui non probare: facilitate
quidem vellem consequi potuisses, ne eius ordinis, quem semper
ornasti rem aut voluntatem offenderes. Equidem non desinam
tua decreta defendere; sed nosti consuetudinem hominum; scis5
quam graviter inimiciipsi illi Q. Scaevolae fuerint ; tibi tamen
sum auctor, ut, si quibus rebus possis, eum tibi ordinem aut re·
concilies aut mitiges: id etsi difficile est, tamen mihi videtur esse
prudentiae tuae.

30. To C. Scribonius Curio (Ad. Fam. ii. 6).

1. Any seemiug haste in my despatch of this letter must be excused by the import-
ance of its subject; a. and the greatness of your past services to me warrants my ssking
of you a favour, for which 1 should be very grateful. 3. Iam most anxious for Milo’s
success in his csnvnss for the consulship, and 1 think your aid is just what is wanted to
secure it; our other resources are ample, 4. and we only want a leader. In Milo yon
will find a friend of the greatest spirit and constaucy. 5. I need not explain to yon
how deeply I am interested in this matter, aud if yon grant my request you will place
me under a lustiug obligation.
