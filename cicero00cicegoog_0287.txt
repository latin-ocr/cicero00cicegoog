n runlrc'tous charge: 1 assisted in his discomfiture. a. ht. Seruilius has been
insigni nith extortion and corruption before the praetor M. Laterensis, but 3.
irnsing to the iguorauoe ol that magistrate no decision has been come to upon his
cnm. aud he is leli rather discredited to stand another trial. 4. The senate has
adoptat various important resolutione about Caeaar's provinces, atter ascertaiuing

Resolutlous (1)That no one interpose any obstacle to the discussion oi this
question iu the senate: (a) That the cluims ol Caesar’s soldiers to a discharge be

says he will not hesitate aster March 1 to aid in providing Caesar with u auoeessor5
aud other expressions oi his show a determination to resist the interiereuce oi tribunes.
He is clearly on bad terms with Caesar ; the latter is anxious sor a compromiae, and
ro. Curio is preparing to resist him. 1 have to thauk Curio ior some Airieen
parathers; let me hare some irom Asia, too. 1 hope you will attend to my claim
upon Sittius.
