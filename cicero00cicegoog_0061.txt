ao INTRODUCTION

Caesar, who had lingered near Rome, now hastened across the Alps
to mccl the Heli-etii, whom he completely defeated¹ near Bibracte. He
afterwards also defeated Ariovistus '.

'l'he legality of the execution of Lentulus, Cethegus, and their asso·
elutos. tlepends on the extent of the powers conferred by the senate's
vote commissioning the consuls to provide for the safety of the state.
t‘ituro maintained* that he might have ordered Catiliue’s execution by
virtue of that decrec3 but the prosecution of Rabirius had shown that
utute of the popular leaders thought differently, and Cicero himself,
hy consulting⁴ the senate as to the punishment to bc inflicted on
lentulus and his accomplices, had seemed to doubt the extent of his own
pmwers ns consul. Cp. Appendix IV.

§an Alter leaving Rome, Cicero repaired at first to the neighbour-
hood of Vibo, in Bruttium, where he had a friend named Sicca; and
there he heard of the enactment forbidding him to live within 400 miles
of Rome ⁵. He was refused an asylum in Sicily by its propraetor,
tf. Vergilius ⁸, who, though a friend of Cicero, was afraid of offending
tho dominant party at Rome. Cicero decided, therefore, on going to
Macedonia ⁷, declining an invitation⁸ to the estate of Atticus in Epirus,
and avoiding Greece for fear of meeting some of the accomplices⁹ os
Catiline who lived there. He went, accordingly, to Thessalonica ¹⁰, where,
under the protection of the propraetor L. Appuleius—which appears, how·
ever, not to have been very heartily given ¹¹—and in the house of his own
devoted friend the quaestor, Cn. Plancius, he lived in security, though in
deep dejection. He apprehended that his brother Quintus, then return·
ing from his administration of Asia, might be persecuted for his sake 1’;
suspected false dealing on the part of Hortensius and others ¹³ ; and was
tormented by fears for his wife and children. He earnestly dissuaded
Terentia from selling part of her property to aid him in his exile ¹⁴.

Towards the close of the year his prospects brightened. On Caesar’s
departure from Rome, Pompey showed himself unable to keep Clodius
in order 3 and the ill-feeling between the two was increased by the escape
of Tigranes ¹⁶—an Armenian prince whom Pompey had brought to Rome
as a hostage, but whom Clodius helped to escape-and by an alleged
attempt of Clodius to procure the assassination of Pompey¹⁶. hloreover,
eight¹⁷ at least of the new tribunes were friendly to Cicero; and of the
consuls elect, one ¹⁸, P. Lentulus Spinther, was a warm friend, the other,
