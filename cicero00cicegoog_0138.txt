pionem de oratione sua sustulit, quem in senatu acerrime nomi·
narat, ut appareret noctem et nocturnam deprecationem inter-
cessisse ; deinde, quos in senatu ne tenuissima quidem suspitione
attigerat, eos nominavit: Lucullum, aquo solitum esse ad se
mitti C. Fannium, illum, qui in P. Clodium subscripserat, L.5
Domitium, cuius domum constitutam fuisse, unde eruptio fieret ;
me non nominavit, sed dixit consularem disertum, vicinum
consulis, sibi dixisse Ahalam Servilium aliquem aut Brutum
opus esse reperiri ; addidit ad extremum, cum iam dimissa con-
tione revocatus a Vatinio fuisset, se audisse a Curione his de 10
rebus conscium esse Pisonem, generum meum, et M. Laterensem.

1. Acerrime, ‘with the greatest ear-
nestness, or decision’

Hominem. Perhaps ‘nominare’ was
a technical term for a denunciation or in·
formation. Cp. Suet. Iul. 173 Livy 39.
17 ‘qui nominatus profugisset!

enumerationem. intercession from
Brutus' mother, Servilia, reported to be on
intimate terms with Caesar.
ι 4 Lucullum. Probably L. Lucullus
rs meant.

Solitum esse, supp. ‘dixit’ from
‘nominarii’ See Madv. 402 a; 403 a.

5. 0. Fannium. Either a tribune of
the year 59 uc. (cp. Pro Sest. 53. 113),
who was afterwards killed about the time
of the battle of Pharsalus, fighting on the
side of Ponipey (cp. Ep. 80, 6), or, if his
not being called tribune here makes a
difficulty, perhaps a C. Fannius who went
as envoy from Lepidus to Sextus Pom·
peius in 43 a. c. (cp. Philipp. 13. 6, 13>;
afterwards joined Sextus, but finally
desened him.

eubseripserat. Indic. as a remark of
Cicero's own. ‘Subscribere in' means to
act as subordinate accuser, ‘junior counsel
for the prosecutiou.' Prof. Tyrrell thinks
that the word is used of the chief accuser
as well, but 1 think it is more commonly
used as above.

1.. Domitium. Foran account of him,
see Ep. 1, 3, note.

6. Εηιῃιίο, ‘the attack on Pompe .'

7. Vicinum. Cicero’s house stoorl on
rhe Palatine (see Intr. to Part I, 5 12),
and so would be near the official residenee
of Caesar, who, as pontifex maximus,
lived in the Via Sacra. Cp. Suet. lul. 46.

8. Ahalam Servilium.. Brutum,
‘some one like Servilius Ahala or Brutus.'
C . Servilius Ahala, as master of the horse

to L. Quinctius Cincinnatus, killed Sp.
Maelius. Cp. Livy 4. ¹4· The Brutus
referred to is of course the L Brutus who
expelled the second Tarquin.

9. Opus esse reperiri, ‘it was de-
sirable should be discovered? On the
constr.. see Madv. 266, and Obs. For
the meaning of ‘opus esse,' cp. Ep. ιο,
4, note; Ep. 29, 25, note.

io. Reroostus, ‘recalled lor further
examination.’ Cp. ln Vat. 11, 26.

VatinIo. For an account of P. Va-
tinius, see lntr. to Parts 1, θῇ 17, 18;
11‚5§2;8;10;1v,54.

11. Pisonem. C. Calpurnius Piso
Frugi married Cicero’s daughter Tullia in
64 u. c., after a betrothal of four years:
see the close of nd Att. i. 3, 3. lleis
often mentioned iu connection with
Cicero’s banishmeut. Cp. lntr. p. ²²5
Epp. 17,2; 18, 4 He was quaestor in
58 iac, and apparently died next year,
before Cicero's return from exile.

M. Laterensem: see Ep. 11, a, note.

12. Beue erat. llere‘erat’ is the epis·
tolary tense, and the following tenses
must be altered accordingly in hunsla-
tion.

Apud Orsssum Divitem. This man
seems to have been one of the praetore
for 59 B. c. But according to Mommsen,
Staatsrecht a. 1, 548, the ‘quaestio de vi'
was not presided over by a praetor but
by a quaesitor taken from among the
judges who might be changed often in
the year. Matth. says the praenouem of
this Crassus was Publius. Little seems
to be known of him, except that some
suppose him to have been a Crassus re·
duced from great wealth to poverty. See
val. Max. 6. 9, 12.

De vi. Carrying weapons in a public
