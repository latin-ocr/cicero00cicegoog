TO THE SECOND PART. 159

to Caesar ; Antonius had been chosen augur in the room of Q. Hor-
tensius in 50 ¹.

ξ 28. (4.) The trials of Appius Claudius Pulcher, Cicero’s predecessor
in Cilicia. Appius was acquitted both of treas0n¹ and of corruption ³,
and presently afterwards was elected censor. He exercised his functions
with great vigour⁴, expelling the historian Sallust, among others, from
the senate.

Caesar was able to devote much time this year to the work of pacify-
ing Transalpine Gaul, which he effected in great measure by indulgencet.
He visited Cisalpine Gaul, however, to recommend Μ. Antonius to the
inhabitants as a candidate for the augurship, and himself lor the consul·
ship⁶in 48 ac. His progress through the different towns was trium-
phant. He then returned to Nemetocenna, and concentrated ten
legions⁷ on the frontiers of the Treviri. The r5th he had left south of
the Alps, and when Pompey required it, Caesar replaced it by the rgth⁸.
Of the rest of his army, four legions under C. Fabius wintered among
the Aedui, and four under C. Trebonius among the Belgae. Caesar
himself went to Ravenna⁹ for the winter· Labienus had been in charge
of Cisalpine Gaul, and Caesar would not ¹⁰ listen to rumours of his
intended desertion.

The result of the election of consuls for 49 ac. had disappointed
Caesar. He had hoped that Ser. Sulpicius Galba ¹¹, one of his officers,
would be chosen ; but the two successful candidates were L. Lentulus
Crus and C. Claudius Marcellus, both decidedly hostile to Caesar.
Marcellus was cousin of his namesake, the consul of the previous year,
and brother of M. Marcellus, the consul of 51 ¹².
