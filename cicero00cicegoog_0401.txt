venustum. Quamquam mihi ista omnia iam addicta vastitati
videntur. Respondi epistolis tribus, sed exspecto alias ; nam me
adhuc tuae litterae sustentarunt. D. Liberalibus.

Forsitan, Manen 18 (705 auc.)

1. 1 have nothing really to say, but to converse with you by letter is my only relief.
s. 1 regret that 1 did not follow Pompey as s soldier follows his general. 1 saw him
full of alarm Just aster the middle of January, and his subsequent errors have estranged
me from him. Now my old affection revives, andI am eager to fly to blm. Yet
what cruel threats be used! how he appealed to the example of Sulla! 3. History
has branded men who have sought restoration to their country by foreign aid; aud
even Marius, Sulla, and Cinna, who appealed to their own countrymen, did much
barm after their triumph. But now that Pompey bas left Italy all seems changed,
and I am only anxious to hasten to his side. Yon approve of my delay; 4-6. 1 have
just turned over a roll of your letters, which I preserve carefully. lfonr constant
advice was, ‘If Pompey leaves Italy do not follow him ;’ and, when 1 thought you
hinted that 1 had better depart, you wrote to deprecate such a course. 7. Then you
suggested that 1 should remain if Μ’. Lepidus and L. Volcatius did so; and they
have remained. ln your other letters 8, 9. yon gave no bint that my conduct had
been at all discreditable. 10. lfou told me that Peducaeus approved my plaus. 1
hope you will defend my conduct before others, as you approved it yourself. We hear
nothing of Caesar's return. Reading over your letters has ealmed me s good deal.

CICERO ATTICO SAL.

Nihil habebam, quod scriberem3 neque enim novi quicquami
saudieram et ad tuas omnes rescripseram pridie; sed, cum me
aegritudo non solum somno privaret, verum ne vigilare quidem
sine summo dolore pateretur, tecum ut quasi loquerer, in quo
uno acquiesco, hoc nescio quid nullo argumento proposito scri-

bere institui. Amens mihi fuisse videor a principio et me unas
ιο haec res torquet, quod non omnibus in rebus labentem vel potius
ruentem Pompeium tamquam unus manipularis secutus sim. Vidi
