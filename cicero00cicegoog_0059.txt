18 INTRODUCTION

whom Cicero had employed as an informer ¹, told the younger Curio
that he had determincd to kill Pompey, and vus arrested on Curio's
denunciation. He then charged several of the leading nobles with
complicity, but he contradicted himself so much that he was not believed,
and was committed to prison, where he was shortly afterwards found
dead. He was probably murdered hythe contrivers ofthe plot. Cicero
charges¹ Vatinius both with suborning and with murdering Vettius3
and both Mommsen³ and Abeken⁴ regard the whole affair as an intrigue
prompted by the triumvirs. Merivale⁵, however, urges that if such had
been the case, Vettius would hardly have named M. Brutus, whose
mother, Servilia, was a favourite of Caesar. He therefore suspects
that some of the more violent optimates were the true authors of the
affair.

Cicero was much vexed by the behaviour of Pompey¹ at times. Of
M. Bibulus he speaks with respect, uot unmixed, however, with irony ⁷.
Before the close of the year he seems to have become thoroughly avare
of the designs of Clodius ¹, but to have been encouraged partly by the
assurances of Pompey⁹‚ partly by the evident unpopularity of the trium·
virs ¹⁰. He declined, therefore, an offer of Caesar to take him to Gaul as
his legate, and also one of the ‘legatio libera,' though the former tempted
him considerably ¹¹.

His principal speeches were—one for his old colleague‚ C. Antonius,
accused of misgovemment in Macedonia, who, however, was con·
demned¹¹3 two for A. Thermus, who was acquitted¹¹; and one, still
extant, for L. Valerius Flaccus, accused of misgovemment in Asia,
but acquitted.

519. The new consuls-as has been said ¹⁴, were connected with the
party of the triumvirs3 and Clodius, now tribune, relying on their aid,
prepared for his attack on Cicero. He previously, however, carried
a number of measures intended to win the favour of various classes
of citizens. He proposed t·-

1. To abolish the small payment hitherto made by recipients of
the public dole of corn ¹¹.

ι. To repeal the Lex Aelia Fufia, which secured that the auspices
should be respected at the time 0 fholding the comitia¹ ¹¹
