NOTE Α optimates.

At the rislr of seeming pedentic, 1 have often used this word to describe one of the
parties of the later Roman Commonwealth3 that ior which Sulla had conquered, which
opposed the concession of extraordinary powers to Pompey, supported Cicero in his
consulship, stmggledin vain against the first triumvirate, and finally coalesced with
Pompey against Caesar. lt cannot properly be called conservative, for some of ita
members were reactionary; nor aristocratic, for many of the noblest familier in Rome
were well represented among its adversaries; nor republican, for many of Caesar's sup·
portcrs were probably long ignorant of the scope of his pians, and not less devoted
⁶ than their opponente to a republican form oi government. The most prominent op·
timates between 63 and 49 nc. were Q. Catulus, L. Lucullus, Q. Hortensius, Q.
Metellus Celer, M. Bibulus, L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, M. Cato, and M. Marcellus.
The senate seems to have been under the control oi the leader of the optimates till
about 57 on the whole, though Pompey had many personal adherente among its mem·
hers. Hence, in notes to letters of the first period, the senate is often spoken of aa
identical with that party; but such identification would be a mistake for the years
following Cicero’a return from erile. See lntr. to Part ll, ς 3, foll.

NOTE 13.. Provr'ncr'a.

This word, oi which the derivation is uncertain, seems originally to have meant ‘a
department of the public service ς’ or, as Mommsen (Rechtsfrage 4, cp. Staatsrecht, 1,
81) and Marquardt (Staataverwaltung, 1, 339) maintain, a special department allotted
for the exercise of the ⁸ imperium.’ Thus the conduct oi the war against a particular
enemy might be called ‘provincia' cp. Livy 1. 40 ad lin.; 31. 6. After the institu-
tion oi the praetorship, ‘iuris dictio' would probably be called the praetor’s 'provincia ;’
and when a second praetor was added to administer justice between citizens and
foreigners, his duties would form a second ‘provincia' Now, when at the close of the
First Punic ll'ar the Romans acquired considerable territory in Sicily, the government
of such territory was entmsted to a new praetor, and called his ‘provincia ;' and sothe
word was applied in general to any administrative district oi the Roman empire, (1)
having definite boundaries, (1) subject to direct taxation, and (3) ruled by a Roman
governor. (Marquardt 1, 340.) The oltl meaning was, however, retained side hy
side with the new. Cp. Ad Q. F. 1. 1, 43: Pro Muren. ao, 41. The provinces, in the
later sense, were probably from the first distinguished from Italy, and aiter the Roman
franchise had been granted to most oi the inhabitants of Italy south of the Po-as it
had been before Cicero entered upon public lile (cp. Smith, Dict. of Geogr. 1, 945,
sub voc. Gallia Cis.)-the distinction mua have become more marked. Land was
generally held on different terms in Italy and in the provinces, except in specially privi-
leged districts of the latter, and the inhabitants oi the provinces were subject, generally
speaking, to personal taxes and to arbitrary punishments from which Italians were ex·
empt. Cp. ln Verr. aAct. 1-3 passim; esp. 5, 66, 169. The Roman or Latin'iran·
chiae might however he conferred citheron individuale oron communities in the pro·
vinces (cp. Ep. 108, 1 ; Dion Cassius 41, 14), but neither appears to have necessarily
implied the exemption of those who enjoyed it from the usual provincial burdens
(Marquardt 1, 360, notes). Noram 1 aware of any grant of the Roman or latin
franchise on a great scale before the time of the dictator Caesar, except in the case of
genuine Roman or Italian colonies. The case of the Transpadani (cp. Appendir 1,
ς 23 Ep. 31, 1, notes) hardly forms an exception, as the province of Cisalpine Gaul
held a peculiar position. Other towns in the provinces differed considerably in their
