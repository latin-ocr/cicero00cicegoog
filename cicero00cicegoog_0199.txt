Cicero eysrke in Milo's defense on ,tpffl &h bn: finan: his usual ahiiity
and success. 'l'be court ras beset hya aurbclent ra'thle. and guarded
by· soldiers; and the unusual sight scena< to have terrified C ioero. Milo
was condemned by 38 to ¹3¹ votes. lle went into enle at Masalia,
and Cicero sent him rbere a copy of the meeth τε non· possess. Milo
acknovvledged it by an ironica] complanent ².

Cicero sucoeeded letter in two speeehes deliteroi on bebalf of
M. Saufeius, vbo had been at the bead of Milo's followers in the alfray⁸
at Bovillae, and tras brought to trial on two charges in consequence.
M. Caelus Rufus joined Cicero in his defenoe; having aheady interested
himself in⁴ that of Milo. Cicero was also much gratitied by the con·
demnation of T. Munatius Plancus Bursa ⁵, one of the violent supponere
of Clodius. Pompey tried in vain to protect Bursa, whose trial took
place in December, after his year of office as tribune had expired.

Cicero seems to have had much occupatiori in the oourts of lave ἦ. but
probably found leisure to begin his work ‘De Legibus⁷,' and possibly to
compose a short treatise ‘De Optimo Genere Oratorum⁸,’ asa prefate
to a translation of Demosthenes’ and Aeschines’ speeehes ‘De Corona'
The fourth book, ‘De Pinibus’,' professes to have been written now,
but really belongs to a later time. Pevv of the letters of this date hate
been preserved, and these have little political interest.

tt some tirne early in the year, before Pompey· was named sole consul
the senate declared the country in danger, and emposered the interrex,
the tribunes, and Pompey, to provide for its safety ¹⁰; authorizing Pompey
to bind the military population of ltaly by an oath of obedience to him·
self. lle bad alreadya considerable force at his disposal, consisting of
men levied nominally for senice in Spain ¹¹. He seeum to have retained
his proconsular imperium since 55 nc„ but to bave been authorined to
enter the city vithout forfeiting his proconsular ‘imperium ¹¹.'

Tacitus ¹³ says that Pompey was in this year ‘auctor idem et sub·
versor' of his own laws3 referring probably to his getting his govern-
ment of Spain prolonged; to the exemption in Caesar's favour above ¹⁴
referred to; to his having sent into court an eulogy of Plancus ¹⁵3 and
to his interposing¹⁸ to prevent thc conviction of his father-inlaw Scipio
for bribery. ln the two last cases he violated the rules prescribed by·
his own laws against riot and corruption.
