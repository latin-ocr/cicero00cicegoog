92 M. TULLII CICERONIS [r>.-i1rr1.

scribas? quem iam ego venire atque adesse arbitror3 ita enim
egi tecum superioribus litteris Valde te exspecto, valde desidero,
neque ego magis, quarn ipsa res et tempus poscit. His de negotiis
quid scribam ad te, nisi idem, quod saepe? republica nihil
5 desperatius, iis, quorum opera, nihil maiore odio: noS, ut opinio
et spes et coniectura nostra fert, firmissima benevolentia ho·
minum muniti sumus. Qua re advola: aut expedies nos omni
molestia aut eris particeps Ideo sum brevior, quod, ut spere,
coram brevi tempore conferre quae volumus licebit. Cura ut
rovaleas.

1. 1. lwas at once pleased aud annoyed by the arrival of Statius; you will miss
him, but gossip about your intimacy with him will bave ceased here before your own
retum. a. Inever suspected him myself, and only wrote you word what others were
saying, that yon might avoid suspicion. Statius could remark for himself what people
said, and how his name especially occurred in their complaints of you. 3. People's
requests to be recommended to him, aud bis own nnguarded expressions, showed sne
how matters stood: hut 1 do not think anything would have been said about him, had
not the rigour of your administration given ollonae. ll. 4. 1 will now aaswer your
letters. Yon complain that I recommended Zeuxis of Blandus to you. This is part
of a more general question. 1 have been anxious to conciliate the Greeks, whose com·
plaints of you were producing considerable effect, and in many cases 1 hare succeeded.
5. As for Zeuxis himself, l received him kindly to silence his complaints of you, and 1
do not think you should have shown such eugemess to punish hirn. 6. Nor is it only
your Greek enemies that 1 try to pacify; I have appeased L Caecilius, and in fact
everybody except T uscenius Ido not complain of your severity to the father of T.
Catienus; but why need you write iu such threatcning language to the son, who is now
at Rome? orto C. Fabius about the two Licinii? y. l have never complained of any·
thing in you, except violence of language and occasional carelessness in your letters
Do you suppose 1 am not sorry when 1 hear of the popularity of Vergilius and Octa-
vius, who are more conciliatory than you, though inferior ia literary cultivation? IIL
8. 1 hope you will be as careful as possible in your correspondenoe, and suppress, if
you can, all letters likely to injure you 9. llou know 1 have often warned you on this
point; do what you can during the remainder of your term of office. 10. L. Flavius
hus just complained of your arbitrary interference with L. Naso’s property, which 1
cannot approve of. 11. ldo notwaot to serve F latius at the expense of your eumenen
but see if you cannot do something for a man in whom Pompey and Caesar are in·
terested. IV. 12. Iam sorry 1 wrote to you hastily about Hermia, and hope yon will
excuse me. 1 arn glad yon are on good terms with Censorinus and others. 13. Yon

ι. Quam. .srbitror, ‘who, 1 suppose, 5. Its. Probably Caesar und Pompey
are already on your way, and at hand) are meant.

3. 1pas ras et tempus, ‘the state of Quorum opens, sc. ‘factum est ut
affairs in itself at the present crisis.¹ nihil esset desperatius)
