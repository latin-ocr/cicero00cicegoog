deprived of citizenship, even by a vote of the people, without his own
consent.

Still less had the senate the power of sentencing citizens to death.
The question is, whether it could invest the consuls with such power.

In practice, its right to do so had not passed unquestioned. L.
Opimius had been accused before the people for his severities in putting
down the insurrection of C. Gracchus; he was, however, acquitted (cp.
Livy Epit. ⁶1); and C. Rabirius had been prosecuted, in the very year 01
Cicero's consulship, for having killed 'a man when co·operating in the
suppression 01 the revolt 01 Saturninus (cp. Intr. to Part 1, § 9). The
truth seems to be, that the senate had usurped illegal powers; that its
usurpation had been largely, though not universally, approved, and that
therefore it is an exaggeration to speak, as Mommsen does, of the execu-
tion of Lentulus as a ‘judicial murder’ (4. 1, 179 and181); and that
opinions seem to have been much divided at Rome, as among modern
scholars, on the question. In addition to Mommsen, Rein, Criminal·
recht, p. 5623 Lange, Rom. Alt. 1. 615 and 6163 Amold, Later Roman
Commonwealth, 1. 331; Drumann 5. 553; all maintain the illegality of
the act, and Dean Liddell (a. 398) implies the same view. Niebuhr
(Lectores, a. 25), decidedly, and the authors 01 the articles ‘consul' and
‘dictator' in Smith’s Dictionary 01 Antiquities, doubtfully, take the other
side; Merivale (ι. 84) is doubtful.

§ r. 1. At Arpinum. This was inherited by Cicero from his father¹;
it was retired, and Cicero seems to have found it an agreeable resi-
dence in spring or summer ². He had there an Amaltheum ³. His
brother Quintus bad two estates near it, called Arcanum and La·
terium ⁴.

a. At Tusculum. This had formerly been the property of Sulla,
then of Q. Catulus ¹⁵. The villa was richly adorned with statues and
pictures, and had a gymnasium attached to it ⁸. Cicero offered this
property for sale⁷ in 57 a.c., but afterwards changed his mind, for we
find him in possession 01 it⁸ at a later period.

3. At Antium. This was an agreeable and retired spot ⁹. Cicero
seems to have sold it before 45 a. c. to M. Lepidus ¹⁰.
