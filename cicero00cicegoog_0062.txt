TO THE FIRST PART. 21

Q. Metellus Nepos, was much under the influence of Pompey, and
proved a placable enemy ².

Various attempta were made, even before the close of 58 ac, to repeal
the act banishing Cicero. Atticus, and his friend, Q. Terentius Culleo, one
of the tribunes, thought of attacking it as a ‘privilegium' or law enacted
against an individual, such laws being probibited by the Twelve Tables.
This course, however, did not seem advisable to Cicero ¹.

L. Ninnius Quadratus, one of the tribunes for 59·58 nc, had brought
in a bill for his direct recall on June 1 ; but, though it met with the
unanimous approval of the senate, one of the tribunes, P. (ilhelius Ligus,
interpo'sed bis veto ³.

On October 29, eight of the tribunes brought in a bill for Cicero's
restoration, on which Atticus asked his opinion. It was not favourable;
some of its clauses seemed to show either negligence or treachery in its

framers ⁴. Cicero wrote from Dyrrhachium, whither he had gone, both
to avoid meeting L. Piso’s soldiers and to be nearer to Italy⁵.

The new tribunes carne into office on Dec. ro, after the consuls had
already departed for their provinces ⁸. T. Annius Milo, T. Fadius, and
P. Sestius, were prominent among the tribunes ⁷, and the whole college
promised to support Cicero. Two, however, Sex. Atilius Serranus and
Q. Numerius Rufus ⁸, subsequently went over to his enemies.

In this year M. Scaurus, son of the celebrated princeps senatus, was
curule aedile, and distinguished himself by the splendour of his shows ⁸,
which exhausted his fortune ¹⁰.

§ aa. Cicero's letters during this year do not show him in a favourable
light. We find him indulging in unmanly lamentations¹¹; suspecting his
best friends of lukewarmness or treachery without adequate grounds ¹²3
regretting the course he had been persuaded to take when it was too
late to alter it ¹³ ; and stooping to unworthy artifices in order to regain
the favour os men whom he had oflended ¹⁴. It must be remembered,
however, that he had been wounded in two most tender points-his
affection for his family and his love ol fame. The patriotism which had
nerved him for the really magnanimous resolution to leave Rome, rather
than expose it to the chances of a civil conflict, did not support him
under the daily weariness and annoyances of a life in exile. Moreover,
the prospect of return was uncertain, and his life was insecure, except
when he was under the direct protection of some official. In spite of
the favourable signs already ¹⁸ mentioned, he was very despondent at the
