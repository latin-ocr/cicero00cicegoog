vvere the most famous¹ tribe, and received the submission of several
tulus on the north-west coast. Towards the close of the year his legate,
Ser. Gulln, was employed in reducing the l’eragri, Nantuates, and
Seduni, near the lake of Geneva², to submission. In honour of these
victories, Cicero supported a vote of fifteen days thanlrsgivings-an
unprecedented distinction ³.

Thus far Cicero, since his return to Rome, had done nothing to
displease‚ and a great deal to gratify, the triumvirs. The next fen·
months witnessed a change of his political attitude.

We have seen that Pompey had quarrelled nith Clodius. Cicero's
restoration could only increase the latter's animosity‚ and he affected
to support Crassus, who had always been jealous of Pompey, and was
perhaps anxious to be sent on a public commission to Alexandria ⁴.

The curious result followed, that a temporary good understanding
uas effected between the leaders of the optimates⁵ and Clodius. This
uas promoted by the interest which Cato had iu maintaining the legality
of the acts of Clodius ⁸. But it must have tended to bring Milo and
Pompey into a closer union.

ξ 2. Our knowledge of the events of the early months of this year
is derived mainly from letters to P! Lentulus Spinther, novr governor of
Cilicia, and to Q. Cioero ⁸, novr in Sardinia, and acting as legate to
Pompey. Clodius had been elected curule aedile ⁹, and so escaped for
a year any danger of prosecution, from which magistrates were exempt
during their year of office ¹⁰. '

In January, Cicero argued in the senate, that P. Lentulus Spinther
should be allowed to restore PtolemyXll. at¹¹ Alexandria But opinions
in the senate were much divided; apassage from the Sibylline books,
forbidding the employment of an army in the transaction‚ was circulated
not nithout ellect5 Cicero himself vas probably somenhat distracted by
the rival claims of Pompey and lentulus, and the affair was adjoumed
indefinitely¹¹.

Next month Clodius accused Milo of riotous proceedings (‘vis'¹⁸).
We have no account of the issue of the trial, but it seems unlilrely that
a conviction should have passed unnoticed.

On Feb. 3, Cicero defended L. Bestia on a charge of bribery before
the praetor Domitius; the trial gave him an opportunity of sounding
