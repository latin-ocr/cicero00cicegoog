conciliatIon-and his determination to retire from the struggle after a
decisive battle.

Many of his letters were written to console friends living in exile, and
to hold out hopes to them of a speedy return to their country. Such
were those to Caecina, Torquatus, 3ηά Plancius ¹. He expressed his
gratitude in the senate for the pardon of M. Marcellus ¹, and subse·
quently pleaded with much independence for that ol Q. Ligarius ⁸, who
was accused before Caesar of having shown peculiar hostility to him in
Africa. N ext year he defended Deiotarus of Galatia, accused of having
plotted against the life of Caesar⁴.

His expressions of opinion on public affairs in the letters of this time
are very guarded, and he seems to have been moved by conflicting
feelings; on theone handl, by regret for the fall of the old constitu-
tion, and lor the loss of his old influential position3 on the other⁰, by
an involuntary admiration ol Caesar's magnanimlty. His dislike' of
some of Caesar’s most prominent adherents remained unchanged, and
may have contributed to dissuade him from mixing in public affairs.
He had little desire ⁸, however, for the triumph either ol the optimates in
Africa, or ol the sons of Pompey in Spain; his hasty abandonment of
his party iu the autumn ol 48 nc. would not have been forgiven in
either case. Caesar's victory at Thapsus relieved him from this appre-
hension for a time; 3ηά he seems to have spent the last half of 46 in
comparative cheerfulness⁰.

§ 7. His family troubles, however, continued. Towards the close of
this year, or at the beginning of the next, he thought it advisable to
divorce Terentia ¹⁰. What grounds for displeasure she had given him
besides her alleged extravagance it is hard to say. His letters to her
during the previous year had been short and rather cold ¹¹.

Cicero was still much in want of money3 and to relieve himself
from his difficulties, married his young and wealthy ward, Publilia ¹².
She seems to have been jealous of Tullia, and to have received little
affection from her husband.

The severest blow which he suffered was the death ¹³ ol his daughter
early in 45 sc. Her unhappy marriage with Dolabella had been
ended bya divorce ¹⁴, 3ηά shortly afterwards she gave birth to a child,
but did not long survive. Her father was long inconsolable; her
society ¹⁸ had been his principal comfort, and neither philosophy ¹⁰ nor
