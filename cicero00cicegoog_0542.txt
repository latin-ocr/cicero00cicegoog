APPENDIX IX.

Csusan’s Laws uwncrnn naou 49-44 ac.

1. Laws proposed by Caesar as dictator in 49 s. c.

1. Lex Iulia (i) de exsulibus-restored, according to some accounts,
all exiles who had been sentenced under the ‘Leges Pompeiae' of 52
ac, except Milo. Caesar's own statement, however, says that it only
applied to a few persons. The plea for this enactment was that the pro-
ceedings for bribery l ‘ambitus ') under those laws had been irregular¹.
The restoration included all exiles whatever except Milo, according to
Appian and Dion Cassius. The act of restoration seems actually to have
been proposed by the praetors and tribunes, and Cicero charges Antony, Α
one of the latter, with having been its author ¹.

a. Lex Iulia de pecuniis mutuis ⁸. Caesar proposed this law as dic·
tator towards the close of 49 s. c. It was intended to provide a remedy
for the scarcity of money caused by the civil war, and enacted that public
valuers should be appointed to ascertain what the worth of land and
other property had been before the civil war. Creditors were then
obliged to talre land at the· value so ascertained in payment of their
claims; whereby about a quarter of what they could otherwise have
claimed was lost. Dion Cassius* mentions also a law limiting to
15,ooo drachmae the amount of gold or silver coin which any one
might possess, but he does not describe it as a new law. Tacitus⁶
seems to include it under a, but his language is not very precise, ‘legem
dictatoris Caesaris qua de modo credendi possidendique intra Italiam
cavetur!

3. Lex Iulia de Transpadanis ⁸,-granting the Roman franchise to the
Gauls living beyond the Po and south of the Alps Tacitus, however,
affirms ⁷ that that grant was made during a nme of peace.

4. Lex Rubria, passed probably at Caesar’s instance to regulata the
jurisdiction of the magistrates of municipal towns in Cisalpine Gaul ⁸.

Perhaps 5. a Lex Hirtia de Pompeianis may belong to this year.
A. Hirtius was tribune in 49-48 and praetor in 47 ac. The import
of the law is doubtful; perhaps it excluded those who had served in
Pompey's army from public offices’.
