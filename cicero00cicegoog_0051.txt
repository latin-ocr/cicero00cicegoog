10 INTRODUCTION

to the plot, the anarchical designs of Catiline must have been represented
by Cicero with much exaggeration, which is in any case probable ¹.
Cicero was well informed by a spy among the conspirators, Q. Curius,
01 their proceedings² ; and invited Catiline in the senate to clear himself.
Catiline replied in language 01 obscure menacel, but Cicero complained
that the senate did not pass decrees sufficiently strong to meet the danger

and left him to provide for his own safety at the consular comitia,
which appear to have been held a few days afterwards and at which
D. lunius Silanus and L. Licinius Murena were elected consuls for
62 a. c. Metellus Celer went to raise forces in Picenum and Gaul 101 the
government, while Catilina, to avoid suspicion, offered himself lor free
custody in the house of some eminent senator. On October ar the
, senate by a decree commissioned the consuls to provide 101 the safety of
the state; and a plot 01 Catiline to murder Cicero and other eminent
men on October 18 failed. He was not, however, discouraged3 and at
a meeting at the house of Μ. Porcius Laeca, on the night of Nov. 6-7,
a fresh plot was formed to murder Cicero, but failed through timely
infonnation being conveyed to the intended victim. On the 8th Cicero
denounced the conspirators before the senate ⁴, and Catiline left Rome
that night. Next day Cicero addressed the pcople in terms 01 nringled
exultation and naming ⁵.

§ru The next decisive step followed the disclosure 01 intrigues
between the conspirators and some envoys of the Allobroges then at ’
Rome. The envoys disclosed the offers made to them, and were
arrested on the night of Dec. 3-4. Documento were found upon
them compromising Lentulus, Cethegus, and others, whereon the latter
were also arrested. The senate, on Dec. 4, voted that they should

¹ I am nware that high authorities spealr more decidedly on this question. Lord
Macaulay (Miscellaneous Worlrs, 1. ²57r Essay on History), hir. De Quincey (Cicero,
vol. vi. ol Collected Worlrs, pp. 231-233, and The Caesars, vol. 111 01 Collected Worlrs,
p. 43), and Professor Beesly rFortnightly Review‚ for May 30, 1865l, all consider that
the plot was a genuine popular movement, and state or implya belief that Cacsar
supported it. Mommsen accepts in the main the ordinary view 01 the conspiracy, but
thinks that the popular party, in its abaseuteut and sear of Pompey, was wi ling to co·
operate with the conspirators. Some 01 the evidence be produces is very striking (cp.
vol. iv. 1, 181-183), but hardly, perhaps, conclusive. T e nature 01 the conspiracy
has been probably somewhat misrepresented, and the character 01 the conspirators
blackened, by Cicero; but, in my judgment, the safest course is, with Merivale (1. 86),
to call the reader’s attention to the suspicions nature 01 the evidence.as derived mainly
from Cicero, and to leave him to form his own conclusions. Sallust, indeed, supporta
Cicero in thc main ; but considerable doubt has been thrown upon the historical
character of his worlr by Mommsen (4. 1, 184) Merivale (History 1. 873 1. 88), and byn
reviewer 01 Deaa Merivale’s worlr ln the Ediuburgh Revicw 101 July 1850. ² Sall.
