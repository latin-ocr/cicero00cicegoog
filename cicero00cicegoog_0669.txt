In attempting to determine this question it will be convenient to dis-
tinguish the periods before and alter the enactment os the ‘Lex Iulia de
Civitate Sociorum' in 90 nc.

A. In the period which elapsed between the complete conquest ol
Italy by the Romans and the enactment ol thc ‘Iex lulia,' Italian cities
must, with very lew exceptions, bave belonged to one ol the following
classes :—

Ι. Coloniae Civium Romanorum. The most ancient ol these con·
sisted oi a small number os Roman citizens sent to act as garrisons
usually in towns on the sea coast. The colonists retained their full
Roman citizenship and combined with it, probably, the right of managing
their local business. Cp. Madv. Opusc. Acad. 1. 243-245; Marquardt,
Rbmische staatsverwaltung, 1. 3⁶· The original population probably

became ‘cives sine suffragio? Praefects were sent lrom Rome to
administer justice in many ol such colonies (cp. Fest. 233, Mllller),
perhaps originally in all ¹, but whether to the Roman settlers, or to the
original population, or to both, does not appear. It is probable that in
all cases the colonial and original population had amalgamated‚ and that
the latter had received the tull franchise, belore the enactment ol the
‘Lex Iulia! Cp. Marquardt, r. 37.

¹ C. G. Zumpt (cp. the list ol authorities at the end ol this appendix) thinks that the
larger colonies oi Roman citizens were never ‘praefecturae' bnt that all other early
communities of Roman citizens outside Rome were. Cp. as to Minturnae, Velleius
(z. 19), who speaks of ‘duoviri' there3 also Plutarch (Marius 39). Α ‘praelectus
Mutinensis' is mentioned in the ‘ Iex Rubria’ (cp. Corp. Inacr. Lat. 1. 11 (205) l,
which was enacted in 49 Β. c.; but ‘quattuorviri iuri dicundo ’ are also mentioned as
existing there. These a pear to have been locally elected magistrates, and must ot'
course be distinguished rom the iunctionaries of the saum name appointed at Rome to
act in Campania, ou whom see below. Cp. Ad Att. 5. 2, 33 A. W. Zumpt, Comment.
Epigr. 1. 54. At Puteoli, another colony ol Roman citizens, mentioned by Festus
