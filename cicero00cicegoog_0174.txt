5 r. In the East, Nicomedes 111 of Bithynia had died in 74 rac„
and had bequeathed his kingdom to the Romans. In the same year,
however, Mithridates renewed hostilities, and at first obtained consider·
able successes, till the arrival of L. Lucullus in Asia changed the aspect
of affairs. Mithridates was defeated, and driven to seek a refuge with his
son-in-law, Tigranes of Armenia. The Roman frontier, however, was
still fluctuatihg; on the whole, it may have nearly coincided with the
course of the Halys. The Romans had three provinces in the East:
Asia, comprising Mysia, Lydia, most of Caria, and part of Phrygia (cp.
Cic. pro Flacco 27, 65); Bithynia, bounded on the north-west by the
Propontis and the Thracian Bosphorus, and ending at the mouth of the
Sangarius, while its eastern frontier was advanced during the Mithridatio
war from the Sangarius'to the Halys or even somewhat further ; and
Cilicia, which, however, can have comprised little or none of Cilicia
proper as a permanent possession before the suppression of piracy by
Pompey (cp. Intr. to Part 1, ξ 7; Appendix a). Lycia had received its
freedom from Sulla as a reward forits attachment to Rome.

In the district between the Adriatic and the Euxine, the Romans had
exerted themselves to secure their frontier, and to conquer or bridle the
robber-tribes of Dalmatia and Thrace, and great, though not complete,
success had attended their efforts. This they owed in great measure to
the ability of M. Lucullus, governor of Macedonia in 73·71 n. c. Mace-
donia, to which lllyricum was probably long annexed, was the only
Roman province in this region, Thrace was still govemed nominally
by its own princes, and Dalmatia was only watched hythe governors of
Cisalpine Gaul, to which Illyricum was subsequently attached.

5 2. Farther west were the two Gaulish provinces. The Cisalpine,
though treated as a part of Italy for some time aller its conquest by the
Romans, and though its southern districts were inhabited by Roman
citizens seems to have been organized as a province at some time
before 63 a.c.¹ (cp. pp. 9; 105 35 ς 37); it extended from the Alps
to the Rubicon and the Macra. Many of the towns in the northern, or
Transpadane, district had received the Latin franchise in 89 a. c., and

were eager to exchange it for the Roman. They thus naturally became
