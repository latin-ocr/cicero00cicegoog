of them, the Martia and fourth, presently deserted to Octavian ¹. With
the others, supported by one of veterans recalled to arms, and appa·
rently by two of recruits, Antony began the siege of Mutina ². After
his defeat before that place, he was joined by P. Ventidius with three
legions, the 7th, 8th, and 9th³, and after he had crossed the Alps, first
Lepidus with seven* legions, then Pollio with three ³, and subsequently
Plancus with four or five ⁶, joined him; four also of the legions of
D. Brutus went over to him in Gaul or Italy ⁷. Antony and Lepidus
when they marched to Italy, left six legions in Gaul under L. Varius
Cotyla⁸ ; and we are told⁹ that at the meeting of the triumvirs near
Bononia at the close of 43 nc, Antony had sixteen legions Octavian
seventeen, and Lepidus ten. These, however, may have included some
new Italian levies.

12. Octavian, towards the close of 44 nc, had at his disposal two
veteran legions of the army of Macedonia, the 4th and Martia, two of
veterans recalled to arms, which were brought up to their full complement
by recruits¹⁰, one of recruits and a praetorian cohort, composed probably
of veterane. With this force he marched to the neighbourhood of Mutina,
and wintered there; Hirtius joined him at the beginning of the next
year¹², and Pansa brought up four legions of recruits in April¹‘, while
he left one¹³ to guard Rome. These forccs suffered heavy losses in the
battles of Forum Gallorum and Mutina ¹⁴. When Octavian preferred bis
claim to the consulship, he had, according to Appian¹⁵, eight legions,
which were joined by three ¹⁶ encamped for the protection of Rome,
and by six which abandoned D. Brutus. Thus the seventeen¹' are ac-
counted for which he had when he met Antony and Lepidus as above
mentioned.
