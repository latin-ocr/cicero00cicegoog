public feeling by political ¹ allusions. Still more was this the caseon the
trial of P. Sestius for riot, in March. He had been active the year
before in promoting Cicero's restoration, and the charge was no doubt
based in part upon his conduct at that time. Other experienced
advocates spoke for the defence; Cicero last, as usual. His speech
was a political manifesto. He still treated Pompey and Caesar with
courtesy on the whole²; but professed unlimited respect for the senate ⁸.
and during the course of the proceedings found an opportunity of
inveighing bitterly against Vatinius, one of the witnesses for the pro·
secution‚ especially on account of his behaviour in 59 s.c.‘ This
cannot bave been agreeable to Caesar, though Cicero affected⁶ not to
consider him responsible for the measures of Vatinius.

Sestius was unanimously acquitted⁸; and this may have encouraged
Cicero to show greater independence for a time.

He soon came again into collision with Clodius. Various prodigies
were reported, and the opinion of haruspices was taken as to what they
portended, and what was the cause of the divine displeasure intim'ated by
thern. The haruspices reported, among other causes, that the gods were
displeased because sacred rites were treated as profane ; and Clodius
instantly, ina speech to the people, applied this to the rebuilding of
Cicero's house. Cicero thought it necessary to argue in the senate
against this interpretation. His speech ‘De Haruspicum Responsis,' is
mainly an attaclt upon Clodius, and he hints⁷ that the optimates should
not be deluded by his flatteries.

The answer of the haruspices seems, however, to have been procured
in the interest of the optimates, and not of Clodius only. lt contained
a warning against dissensions among the nobles which might lead to the
concentration of all powers in the hands of one man⁸, with reference
perhaps to the proposal of C. Messius. The confused state of parties
was shown by the acquittal of Sex. Clodius, prosecuted by Milo at the
instance of Pompey; for be owed his acquittal to the votes of the
senatorial⁹ portion of his judges.

ξ 3. A political crisis had been for some time approacbing. Various
circumstances had raised the spirits of the optimates, as we have seen;
the enthusiasm with which the Italians had greeted Cicero’s return; the
electiori of consuls favourable‚ or not adverse, to the old constitution; the
acquittal of Sestius, indicating the temper of the tribunals3 the quarrels
among the triumvirs and their instruments. Even Cicero was inspired
with unwonted confidence and decision, and became for a moment the
spokesman of the optimates ¹⁰.
