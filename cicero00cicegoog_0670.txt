620 'APPENDJX XII.

Colonies of Roman citizens were also established beyond the limits of
Italy proper, the earliest at Parma and Mutina, in Cisalpine Gaul, in 183
a. c. These were established principally for military reasons aud seem
to have undergone no change of status before the time of Cicero. Cp.
Livy 39, 55 ; hladv. Opusc. Acad. 1. 302.

Others were established or proposed, nearly all in Italy, by C. Gracchus
and by M. Livius Drusus the elder, as a means of relieving the distress of
the poor at Rome. Cp. Plut. C. Gracch. 8; 93 Livy Epit. 60, App.
Bell. Civ. 1. ²33 24; A. W. Zumpt, C. E. 1. ago-2393 Madv. Opusc.
Acad. 1. 303.

A. Gellius (N. A. 16. 13) says that the ‘coloniae civium Romanorum'
had less independence than the municipia.

11. Municipia. The term ‘municipium' is supposed by h‘larquardt
(1. 28) to have originally denoted the status of ‘cives sine suffragio,’ and
to have been transferred to the various communities the members of
which held that status. Such communities appear to have been divided
into two classes; one of them retaining more of local sels-govemment
than the other. Paulus Diaconos (Fest. 127, hlliller) gives Tusculum,
Lanuvium, and Formiae, as examples of the first or more favoured class;
Aricia, Caere, and Anagnia, of the other. Livy, however, couples Aricia
with Lanuvium (8. 14),and Cicero's language in one passage tends to
support Livy (Philipp. 6. 6, 15).

To some of these municipia praefeets were sent from Rome to ad-
minister justice. At first such officers were appointed by the praetor
urbanuS, but according to Livy (9. ao), after the year 318 ac. four
(⁴ quattuorviri iuri dicundo ') were elected¹ to act at Capua and other
places Others were still appointed by the praetor urbanus. Thus
there were two classes of ‘praefecturae’ or towns to which such officers
were sent (cp. Festus 23 3, Mtiller), and a considerable number of towns
might for some time be called with equal propriety ‘municipia' or
‘praefecturae’ The four praefects appointed to act in Campania were
rechoned among the viginti sex viri-on whom cp. Smith, Dict. of
Antiq- r>- 119⁶ (2. 955(

lt is to be noticed that no names of old Latin towns nor of old
colonies of Roman citizens occur in the list of praefecturae given by
Festus Perhaps the inhabitants of such places had to bring their cases
before the praetor urbanus for trial. It is true that a praefect is men-
tioned in an inscription, of the time of the emperor Claudius probably,

¹ ln the comitia tributa. cp.A.Ge11. ¹3· 15,4; Lange, Rom. Alc ¹· 7⁵03 7⁵⁶·
But as the names of such ‘quattuorviri' are omitted in the lists of magistrates recited

in the ealier laws, Mommsen thinlrs that Livy was mistaloen in supposing that they
were elected by the Roman people before the seventh century of the city. Cp.
