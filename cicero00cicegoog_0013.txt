vviii PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.

readings in Cratander's edition, the third to a fragment preserved
in two portions at Munich and Wilrzburg, containing several
letters ol book XI and some ol book Vl, audthe fourth to
the Codex Tornaesianus (L), now lost ; to which, especially as
quoted by Lambinus, other critics are disposed to give more
weight; Wesenberg placing it first of all.

The Medicean MS. os the letters to Atticus and Quintus (M.)
is now thought by O. E. Schmidt, A. Viertel, 3ηά G. Voigt to be
a copy, taken at Milan soon alter1390 Α. 1). for the F lorentine
statesman Coluccio Salutato from an original seen by Petrarch
at Verona in 1345, and copied by him. Petrarch’s copy appears
to have been lost, but may have been used for some of the
numerous corrections ol M. by Coluccio and by later hands;
others being perhaps derived lrom independent MSS. now
lost.

A list os the principal works which 1 have consulted in illustra-
tion ol the letters will be lound on pxxiii loll: and my obligations
to many of them, especially to Professor Tyrrell and to Mr. G. E.
Jeans‚ will also appear srom my notes. This, however, is perhaps
the proper place to acknowledge the great assistance which Ι
have derived from Mommsen's history in preparing my intro-
ductions—especially on pp. 3, 43 139-144; and to Briickner’s
Life os Cicero in Appendix V. I regret that Mr. J. R. King’s
notes¹ on the Philippics only refer to a small though very im-
portant partos Cicero's lii .

Ι need hardly refer to Mr. Froude's ‘Caesar' and to Mr.
Trollope’s Lile ol Cicero. Ι am glad that writers ol such estab-
lished popularity should have employed themselves in making
the great names ol Roman history more familiar to English
readers These two books have furnished, wholly or partly,
occasion lor the appearance of articles in the Edinburgh Review
for October 1879, and in the Quarterly Review sor October
1879, and October 1880, which Ι must regard as valuable con-
tributions to Roman history without prolessing complete agree·
ment with either ol them.

I can hardly leave unnoticed the very able and unsparingly
hostile criticism os Cicero's career and character prefixed by

¹ The Philippic Orations ol M. Tullius Cicero, with English notes, by the Rev. J. R.
Ring (Clareudon l'ress Series), 8νο, Oxlord, 186& [Secund Edition, ¹⁸7⁸]-
