PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION. xi

and the epitomes of the lost books of Livy, so far as they
illustrate the life of Cicero The ‘Catiline’ of Sallust, though
its historical character has been seriously questioned (cp. p. ιο),
may be added ; and the second book of the history of M. Velleius
Paterculus, though the latter seems to have been rather pre· ·
judiced.

O. E. Schmidt (Letzte Kampfc, 670—687) gives much weight
to the fragments ol a life of Augustus (βίος Καίσαρος) by N icolaus
of Damascus. The author appears to have been in the service
of the Herod family, and to have visited Rome three times
during the life of Augustus. What remains of his works will be
found in Mitller's Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum, vol. iii.
Paris, uocccxunr.

Later writers, such as Appian, Dion Cassius, Plutarch, and
Suetonius, are of course to be followed with caution except when
they name their authorities They had success, however, to in-
dependent contemporary, or nearly contemporary, sources of
information; e. g. the public Acta; lost letters or speeches of
Cicero, and of his correspondents; and the works of Libol, Livy,
Oppius ², Pollio³, Tanusius Geminus ⁴, and others ⁶.

My introductions and notes will show that 1 accept in the
main Professor Mommsen's⁶ view of the party struggles of Rome
during the last century of the Commonwealth's existence. 1 do
not, however, agree with all his judgments upon persons.

References to the contents of this book made in the notes are
either to the pages or to the numbers of letters or of sections of
Introductions and Appendices in this edition. But in notes to
the Introductions and Appendices, where references arc very
numerous, l have, to avoid confusion, referred uniformly to the Ι
letters as arranged in the ordinary editions.

l have to repeat the acknowledgments made in previous editions
to the Delegates of the University Press, to the Dean of Christ

⁵ O. E. Schmidt (L. K. p. 686) thinks that Suetonius iu his lives of Julius and
Octavius, was largely indebted to N icolaus of Damascus.

⁶ As far as the struggle between Caesar and Pom ey is concerued, Dean Merivale
and the majority of rcccnt English writers on Roman history have anticipated or con-
curred with Mommsen in maintaining that Caesar’s triumph was expedient. Frieudly
but candid biographical notices of some of Caesar’s priucipul opponente will be found
in Professor Goldwin Smith's article on ‘The Lust Republicaus of Rome’ iu Mac·
urillau’s Magaziue for April 186⁸.
