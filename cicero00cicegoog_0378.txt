55. T 0 Atticus (Ad Att. viii. 9).

Formis, Fss. 25, 49 nc. (705 suc.)

1. 1 am not annoyed by the publication of my letter to Caesar, and 1 think its
language justified by the end 1 had in view. a. Pompey has used expressions quite
as complimentary, and your conduct, and that of many others, hasbeen quite as
equivocal as mine. 3. 1 wish to be st Arpinum on the nuth, end then to spend some
days in my various villas. I am very glad you approve of the line of conduct 1 pro·
pose to follow¹ The clemenoy of Caesar, compared with Pompey's desertion of his
friends, is doing our cause much herm. 4 The two Balbi both assure me that
Caesar’s views are moderate aud pacific. 1 suppose Pompey may have reached
Brundisium by now, but the ‘monster' shows remarkable energy.

hominem, non videbar ullo modo facilius moturus, quam si id,
quod eum hortarer, convenire eius sapientiae dicerem. Eam si
‘admirabilem’ dixi, quoniam eum adsalutem patriae hortabar,
non sum veritus ne viderer adsentari, cui tali in re lubenter 10
me ad pedes abiecissem. Qua autem est ‘aliquid impertias
temporis,' non est de pace, sed de me ipso et de meo officio ut .
aliquid cogitet3 nam quod testificor me expertem belli fuisse,
etsi id re perspectum est, tamen eo scripsi, quo in suadendo
plus auctoritatis haberem, eodemque pertinet, quod causam eius15
