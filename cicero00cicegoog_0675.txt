Ihave found it convenient to reserve lor thIs place a reconsideration
ol the dates ol some ol the letters written or received by Cicero aud
his correspondents aiter Caesar's death.

1 have derived great assistance in attempting to ascertain theru
from the papers os B. Nake, mentioued on p. xxvi3 srom a disser-
tation ol Ο. Ε. Schmidt, ‘De epistulis et a Cassi0 et ad Cassium post
Caesarem 0111111111 datis quaestiones chronologicae,' Lips. 1877; and
from an article ol the same writer in Jahrbiicher 1111 Classische
Philologie‚ 1884, referred to in note 1.

¹ D. Brutus had joined his army iu Cisalpine Gaul uot later probably 111111 about
April rath, as Atticus bad received the news not later thau April 19 (cp. Ad Att.
14. 13, 1-1). Now D. Brutus does not write iu this letter as one just about to take
1 decisivo step (17151 2-3), aud Ο. E. Schmidt (Jahrbiicher sur Class. PhilologIe,
1884, pp. 334-6) argues that the letter was written very early ou 1111111117. Buta
passage oi Nicolaus of Damascus (Vit. Caes. c. 17) which he quotes iu support ol
that date, hardly seems to me to agree so closely with this letter 11 to decide the
question. OAE. Schmidt's paper is largely occupied in discussiug points which
