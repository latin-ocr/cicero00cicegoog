ln the time then of Cicero'a political activity we can recognize two kinds of ‘Impe-
rinm,’ (1) that held by consuls or praetors¹ during their year of office at Rome (cp. ln
Verr. 1 Act. 13, 373 In Ρ11.13,19; Messalla ap. Α Gell. 13, 153: (1) that held by
promacial goremors, or by commissionem specially invested with itz inMommsen's
words the ‘imperinm domi’ and ‘imperinm militiaez' terma which do not so much
perhaps define the quality of the ‘Imperium' as the sphere of its exercise. Cp.
Mommsen, Staatsrecht, pp. 953 100.

The military ‘Imperium' ¹ was not ordinarilyexercised by the consuls in Italy after
the change above referred to had taken place, nor indeed, was there ordinarily occasion
for its exercise. Sallust (Cat 19) seems to hare thought that a special vote of the
senate was needed to invest a consul with it. As the more important jndicial smetioas
had been long since transferred to the praetors and permanent courts, the ordinary
‘Imperium’ of the consuls must have consisted, apparently, in practice of little more
than the right of convolring the ‘comitia centuriata' for elections and for legislation;
aright which probably rested upon the ‘Imperium' Cp. A.Ge11.13,15; 13, 173
Varro 1. L. 6, 88-93.

The ‘Imperium’ of provincial gorernms comprised, like 11111 of 'the old Roman
kings, military, administrative, and judicial powers, and was probably only limited
locally while the govemor's term of office lasted. After that term had expired, he
might of course be prosecuted for misgovernment. He seems to have entered ou the
exercise of his ⁴ Imperinm' in a certain sense when he left Rome with proper ceremony
(⁸palndatns') ; bnt not to have held it in its entirety till he reached his province.
Cp. Mommsen, Rechtsfrage 343 35. He lost it altogether, except for the day of a
triumph, when he recrossed the promoerium, or ancient sacred limit of the oity of
Rome. Cp. Ep. 19, 153 Philippa 11, 17 and Mr. King's note, Ulpian, Digest. 1.
1616. 11 could be granted to private persons by the people-as more than once to
Pompey (cp. Intr. to Part 1, ἧς 43 73 8) :—and was apparently conferred by the
senate, though with some irregularity, on vannus persons in 49 nc. (cp. Caes Bell.
Ciar, 6), and on Octavian in 43 11. e. (cp. Philipp, 5. 16, 45).

The unconstitutional combination of powers in the hands of Pompey during his third
consulship was altogether exceptional. Cp. Intr. to Part 11, §l 143 15 ; Mommsen

The title ¹ Imperator' seems during the republican period to have been of a purely
military character. Perhaps it could legally be assumed by any officer who had been
invested with the military ‘ Imperium.' Cp. Dion Cassius 43, 443 Α. W. Zumpt, S. R.
131, 133. ln practicehowever, 1 think that it seems only to have been borne by
officers possessed of ‘Imperium’ who had obtained successes in war, and had con·
sequently been greeted as ‘Imperatores’ by their soldiers. Cp. Ad Aa 5. 20, 33 Tac.
Ann. 3. 743 Mommsen, Riim. Staatsrecht1o5. It was oflen confirmed by a vote of
the senate. Cp. Philipp. 14, 43 53 In Pis 19, 44

For an account of the title ‘Imperator' prefix'ed to the names of the emperors, cp.
Dion Cassius (53. 17), who considers it equivalent to that of king or dictator, also
Mommsen 4. 1. 43ο3 Α. W. Zumpt, S. R. 1313 133.

¹ It is doubtful if the possession of ‘Imperium’ was necessary for the praetore who
Εἲέῗ ἰιιὲἓξῐὲήωίηύ courts, or 'quaestiones perpetuae! Cp. Mommsen, Rechts·

² Inse this term as the nearest equivalent for ‘Imperium militiae’ iu Mommsen’s
work, though admitting that it is not quite accurate.
