ar. 6.] AD ATTICUM I. ¹3· 41

minitanti nobis per litteras hoc rescribo atque respondeo: ego
dolori tuo non solum ignosco sed summam etiarn laudern tribuo ;
meus enim me sensus, quanta vis fraterni sit amoris, admonet.
A te peto ut tu quoque aequum te iudicem dolori meo prae·
beas3 si acerbe, si crudeliter, si sine causa sum a tuis oppug·5
natus, ut statuas mihi non modo non cedendum, sed etiam tuo
atque exercitus tui auxilio in eius modi causa utendum fuisse.
Ego te mihi semper amicum esse volui ; me ut tibi amicissimum
esse intellegeres, laboravi. Maneo in voluntate et, quoad voles
tu, permanebo citiusque amore tui fratrem tuum odisse desinam ιο
qnam illius odio quicquam de nostra benevolentia detraham.

6. To Atticus (Ad Att. i. 13).

r. l have received three letters from yon, bnt uncertainty asto your movements, and
the want of a faithful messenger, have interfered with my promptitnde in replying,
a. though interesting events have happened since our parting. The consul Piso has
rather slighted me,bnt lam not sorry to be relieved from the need of showing him
any respect; his colleagne honours me, and is devoted to the good cause. 3. The
disngreement of the consuls is unfortunate, and I fear its effects may be aggravated hy
an affair of which yon have probably heard, virn that P. Clodius hasbeen detected
in the house of C. Caesar when the rites of the Bona Dea were being celebrated, and
that Caesar has divoroed his wife in consequence. Proceedings against Clodius are irr
progress, bnt are not pressed with the energy one could wish. 4. Ioannot say that a
certain friend of yours is behaving honestly or straightforwardly just now. 5. The
praetors' provinces have not yet been allotted. I arn obliged to yon for yonr remarks
and criticisma on various works which l have sent yon. 6. A purchase lately made
by the consul Messalla, shows that l have not made a bad one in my house. Teucris
still keeps me waiting. l hope soon to write with more freedom.
