aa. oa] AD FAMILIARES VI. 7. 45¹

claros viros nominarem levat enim dolorem communis quasi

relegis et humanae condicionis recordatio. Exponerem etiam,
quem ad modum hicet quanta in turba quantaque in confu-
sione rerum omnium viveremus; necesse est enim minore desi·
derio perdita re publica carere quam bona. Sed hoc genere nihil 5
opus est: incolumem te cito, ut spero, vel potius, ut perspicio,
videbimus. Interea tibi absenti et huic, qui adest, imagini animi
et corporis tui, constantissimo atque optimo filio tuo, studium,
officium, operam, laborem meum iampridem et pollicitus sum et
detuli; nunc hoc amplius, quod me amicissime quotidie magis 10
Caesar amplectitur, familiares quidem eius, sicuti neminem.
Apud quem quicquid valebo vel auctoritate vel gratia, valebo
tibi : tu cura ut cum firmitudine te animi, tum etiam spe optima
sustentes
