APPENDIX VI. 297

Rome, and therefore on the first of January ¹. Under the new system a
governor might enter on his government at any time. Cicero's gosem·
ment of Cilicia began on July 31²·

The clause inserted by Pompey, on his own authority, in the law after
its enactment, to release Caesar from its restrictions, could hardly be
considered valid ³.

ᾗ 4. Thus Caesar had no legal claim to retain his provinces for longer
than the time granted him by the ‘Lex Pompeia Licinia' of 55 rac. He
had, however, an equitable claim as against Pompey, whose negligence
or treachery had withdrawn a privilege granted with his own sanction;
and he had various constitutional modes of securing attention to his
demands.

It does not appear that the ‘Lex Pompeia de irue magistratuum’
was retrospective; hence, as it passed in 52 n.c., no ‘consulares'
or ‘praetorii’ would be qualified under it till 46. Perhaps the
senate was to provide⁴ for the government of the provinces during
the interval. Now

(α) The ‘Lex Sempronia de provinciis' of C. Gracchus provided that
the provinces of the future consuls should be fixed before their electiony
and though recent legislation‚ and the frequent assignationes provinces
by special votes may have diminished its authority, it seems to have
been thought desirable to deliberate on the appointment of a suc-
cessor to any province some time before a vacancy occurred. But
Pompey thought⁶ himself pledged to Caesar not to allow any motion
to be put to the senate with reference to the Gallie provinces before
March 1, 50 rac, which would much shorten the time available for
discussion.

(b) lt would be difficult, perhaps, to find men of consular ranis to
succeed Caesario both his provinces, and if this were not done, any
tribune might interpose⁰ to prevent the nomination of a‘praetorius'
to succeed him in either.

(c) A majority of the senate was indisposed for decided measures ¹.

§5. Under these circumstances, the preliminary discussion about
eaesars recall opened on' Sept. 29, 51 nc. The senate passeda
decree ‘that the assignment of the consular⁸ provinces should occupy
