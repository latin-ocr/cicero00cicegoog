audisse3 nam Curtius noster dibaphum cogitat, sed eum insector
moratur. Hoc adspersi, ut scires me tamen in stomacho solere
ridere. De Dolabella, quod scripsi, suadeo videas, tamquam si
tua res agatur. Extremum illud erit: nos nihil turbulenter, nihil
temere faciemus3 te tamen oramus, quibuscumque erimus in5
terris, ut nos liberosque nostros ita tueare, ut amicitia nostra et

tua fides postulabit.
