346 M. TULLII CICERONIS [esur 111.

so much as your letters oi advice. a. Icome now to your second letter. Our reports
from Brundisium were ialse iu two points Iam sorry the consuls have lest Italy;
their departure makes war inevitable, and its beginning will be attmded by lamine:
Pompey‘s fneuds iuteud to blockade Italy. Ishould certainly not join such a party
but lor my persoual obligations to its leader. Yon rightly waru meto sbew a be·
coming independeuce when 1 meet Caesar. I shall not go to Arpinum till Caesar has
passed by this place. 3. Philotimus bas been slow iu retuming to you, Domitius,
1 think, is near Cosa as you say: uo oue seems to know his plaus What aworthless
man is be who says that a praetorem preside at the election ol consuls! but he acts
iu character. Perhaps Caesar is anxious lor my presence in the senate as a sanction
to such a step. May 1 die tirstl 4. Yon are quite right in your gloomy anticipatione
about the war. Tell Trebatius that I shall be very glad is be will visit me before
Caesar comes to this neighbomhood. 1 am glad that you think oi buying Phamea's
estate at lanuvium but sear that lauded property is very insecure just now.
