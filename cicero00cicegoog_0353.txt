304 INTRODUCTION

Luceria, and seems to have done nothing¹ in support oi his party at
Capua, an attitude which he represented rather differently to Pompey ¹,
and to Caesar ⁸. He criticised‚ probably without much judgment‚ the
military conduct⁴ ol Pompey‚ especially his desertion of the capital and
failure⁶ to relieve Domitius, and was easily deterred by rumours of
danger from attempting to comply⁸ with invitations to Luceria and to
Brundisium.

§ 5. On the other hand, Cicero was disgusted' with many os Caesar's
followers, and regarded his conduct as sheer rebellion ⁸. Hence he felt
little inclination to appear in the senate at Rome ⁹, and at times was more
confident than usual ol the success ol Pompey‚ especially alter some
demonstrations in his favour at Capua ¹⁰, and the arrival os Labienus ¹¹ at
Teanum, who appears to have confirmed a general impression ol the dis·
affection ¹² ol Caesar’s army to its general. On January 27, Cicero, in a
letter to Tiro ¹³, enlarged on the preponderance oi the loyal forces. He
was also encouraged ¹⁴ at times by exaggerated statements os the numbers
and efficiency ol the army ol Domitius at Corfinium, andos successes
obtained in the Pyrenees hy Afranius over Caesar's lieutenants.
Dread ol the opinion ol the optimates, and an old feeling of inde·
pendence, seem, however, to have mainly weighed ¹⁵ with him in lavour
of going to the camp of Pompey; and he thought he was hardly
treated with sufficient respect ¹⁰ by Caesar’s dependents, especially by
the two Balbi.

Accordingly he ordered ships to be prepared both at Brundisium and
at Caieta, but still delayed1' to embark.

βό. Amid all this excitement Cicero did not iorget his ireedman
Tiro, whom he had left ill at Patrae, and osten urged ¹⁸ him to be
caresul ol his health. With another dependent ¹⁹, Dionysius, he was
on less friendly terms: complained²⁰ ol his ingratitude and insolence,
and was gratified by his departure, while acknowledging his merits as

ξ 7. Cicero probably spent April and May on the coast ol Campania
or in the neighbourhood ol Arpinum. Caesar visited him ²² near Formiae,
and entreated him to attend in the senate at Rome. Cicero, however,
did not consent. This interview must have taken place towards the close
