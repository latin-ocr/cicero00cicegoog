With regard to the letters ‘Ad Quintum Fratrem,’ Baiter says

(in the preface to vol. IX os his edition os CIcero's works), ‘ unicus

edition oi Cicer0, published In1783, denoted there as Q, and
numbered XLII among the ‘Codices Latini’ oi the college in
Mr. H. O. Coxe’s catalogue, while 2 seems to be that preserved
in the library ol Balliol College, collated also for the edition
above mentioned, in which it is denoted ψ 1 B, and numbered
248c In Mr. Coxe's catalogue. Both are considered by Ο. E.

For the letters to AttIcus, Baiter assigns the first place to the
Medicean MS. (Plut. XLIX, XVIII), the next to the marginal
