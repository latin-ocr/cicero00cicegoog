reduced, and seems to have avoided the capital as much as possible.
In a eurious letter¹ to L. Lucceius, Cicero entreated him to write an
eulogistic account of his services and sufferings, and not to confine
himself strictly to the truth.

Tullia was betrothed² in the spring to Furius Crassipes, but a marriage
does not seem to have ensued. Atticus married Pilia on Feb. 12 ³, 3ηά
Cicero often notices her in his later letters.

ς 7. In Gaul, Caesar reduced the Veneti, 3ηά afterwards the Morini
and Menapii. P. Crassus, one of his officers‚ conquered the Aquitani,
and another, Sabinus, the Unelli ⁴.

In Syria, Gabinius seems to have gained successes over Aristobulus,
who had escaped from Italy ⁶. He thought himself entitled to a
‘supplicatio’ but the senate, greatly to Cicero's satisfaction, refused it
on May⁸ 15. Cicero accuses⁷ him of corruption and extortion‚ very
possibly with good grounds; but the unpopularity of Gabinius with the
¹ publicani' may have arisen from his consulting the interests of the pro·
vincials-the Jews and Syrians, of whom Cicero speaks as ‘born for
slavery.'

Piso had been as unscrupulous, and less successful, in Macedonia.
He had oppressed and despoiled the subjects of Rome, 3ηά Cicero says⁸
that his army melted away without meeting an enemy. Perhaps this
was the reason why he was recalled sooner than Gabinius. The senate
resolved that Piso should be succeeded‚ at the beginning of 55 nc, by
Q. Ancharius Priscus, apparently⁹ one of the praetors for 56 ; while
Gabinius was to be succeeded by (the consul) M. Crassus at the begin·
ning of 54

It appears that C. Cato, one of the tribunes, interfered with the
electiori of consuls for 55 s.c.; hence an interregnum ¹⁰ intervened,
followed by a very turbulent election, at which Pompey and Crassus
were choseu. Their most formidable opponent was L. Domitius
Ahenobarbus.

ς 8. The new consuls applied themselves at once to securing their
position. The election of praetors took place without delay, and, owing
to gross brihery, Vatinius was elected and Cato defeated ¹¹. Α law was
proposed by C. Trebonius, assigning to the consuls the government of
Spain and Syria for five years. Pompey obtained Spain, and Crassus
