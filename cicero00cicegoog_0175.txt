The Transalpine province, or Narbonensis, consisted 01 3 broad strip
01 13ηά stretching from the Alps to the Pyrenees, and encircling the
nominally independent territory 01 Massilia. lts outposts seem to have
been—on the west, Lugdunum Convenarum (St. Bertrand) and Tolosa
(Toulouse); on the north and north-east, Vienna (Vienne) and Genava
(Genera). An unruly spirit prevailed in considerable districts 01 this
territory, especially among the Allobroges.

The two provinces lnto which the Roman conquests in Spain were
divided had just been reorganized by Pompey, aiter the death 01 Serto·
rius and the dispersion 01 his followers. The influeuce 01 Pompey was
predominant, at least in the Hither province, lor many years.

ξ 3. ln Africa the Roman irontier might be occasionally, but not
seriously, threatened by the tribes 01 the interior. The province called
Africa consisted mainly 01 the territory which Carthage had retained just
beiore the third Punic war, which had perhaps been increased aiter the
war with Jugurtha by the addition 01 the Tripolis (Leptis, Aea, 3ηά Sa·
brada), and was very important srom its fertility, which enabled it to
supply Rome with much corn. The neighbouring lrings of Numidia
could hardly be lormidable‚ unless aided by dissensious or corruption
among the Romans.

Cyrene, with the lour neighbouring towns 01 Apollonia or Sozusa,
Teucheira or Arsinoe, Euesperides or Berenice, 3ηά Barca or Ptolemais,
had been bequeathed to the Romans by Apion, an Egyptian prince, in
95 nc, 3ηά reduced to a province, probably in 75 or 74 nc. Cp.

'l'he three great islands 01 the western Mediterranean had long been
subject directly to Rome. Sicily had been seriously impoverished by
three years 01 misgovernment under C. Verres, and its important supplies
01 com must have been much diminished.

Sardinia, with which Corsica was combined as one province, also pro·
duced much com. These islands had principally to sear insurrections
01 slaves and depredations 01 pirates.

Greece was probably subject to the governors 01 Macedonia; the
organization 01 3 distinct province of Achaia belonging to a later period.

Crete was conquered in 67 nc. by Q. Metellus, and was annexed‚
according to some, to Cyrene, according to othere, to Macedonia.
A W. Zumpt holds the latter view (C. F. a. 187-189, and 240). Cp.
