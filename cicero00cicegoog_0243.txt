1. Iam glad you have rewarded Eutychides with his freedom a. 1 approve oi
your joumey to Asia, buthe sure lo return by the promised day. 3. 1 have written to
γοα osten and fully, but you seem uot to hare received all my letters, aud 1 write so
ireely that this makes me rather uneasy. ι( The eormptiou ol our courts has beera
lately shown ou the trials oi Salmas, Cato, and Procilius. 1 did not defend Procilius,
out ol consideration ior Tullia, who seared a fresh breach with Clodius, his accuser.
5. A dispute between the citizens ol Reate and Interamna took me lately to the former
place; ⁶. on my return to Rome 1 was very well reoeived in the theatre. 7. 'lhe meat
demand lor money to be spent in bribery has actually doubled the rate oi interest, aud
the result ol the consular elections is very doubtful 8. Iwill iulorm γοα oi it illhear

as he can
