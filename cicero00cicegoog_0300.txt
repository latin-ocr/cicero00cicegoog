36. To Atir'cus (Ad Att. v. 21).

Lnonrcsrr, Fas. 13, 50 s. c. (704 nnc.)

r. lam glad you have arrived safely in Epirus. a. The successes of C. Cassius
have been much exaggerated‚ and the movements of the Parthians are very threatening.
Under these circumstances, 3. Ι fear that the dispnte between Caesar and Pompey
may indirectly lead to the prolongatiou of my term of office3 aud you seem to have
some such apprehension yourself. 4. Your letters do not reach me very regularly. 1
will do what 1 ean ior M. Laenius. 5. 1 arn much obliged to you for what you told
M. Octavius, use the same lauguage in all doubtful cases My moderatiora md
integrity are unprecedented, and all my officers, except 1. Tullius, follow my example.
6. At the beginning of winter Ι put Quintus ln charge of Cilicia and my winter camp,
aud sent Q. Volusius to Cypros. 7. 1 left Tarsus ou Jannary 5, and crossed the
Taurus3 my arrival in the districts beyond that mountain had been engerly expected.
1 have relinquished fees which were a heavy burden to our subjecta, aud 1 allow no
expensive honours to be paid me. 8. The distress caused by famine has been greatly
mitigated by my exertions3 lhave induced many holders of comto bring ont their
stores. 9. I mean to devote three months to the judicial business of my northern and
western districts and then to spend June in Cilicia, and July in retnming through my
province; 1 ought to leave it on J nly 30, and hope my brother will consent to act as
my successor. 10. Now for the affair of Brutus. He recommended to me two men
who have lent money to the pcopie of Salamls; one of them, Scaptius, visited my
camp, and Iprornised to do what 1 could for him. 1 refused, however, to give him
a command, aud ordered some horsemen, whom Appius had placed at his disposui,
to leave Cyprus. 11. Afterwards a deputation from Cyprus came to me, and 1 asked
them to pay Scaptius. They said they were quite willing to do so, but Scaptius
claimed most usurious interest, which was specilied in his bond: my edict had
named a more moderate rate. ra. 1 thought Scaptius miscoustrued the decrees of
the senate on which he relied. He afterwards tried to represent the debt as larger
than it really was, but the Salaminians showed him his mistalre, and were eager to
pay what they really owed. 1 yielded, however, to Scaptius, so far as to leave the
' case unsettled. 13. l am sure any fair jndge would say that Brutus ought not to
complain, especially considering some decrees recently made on the subject, which,
hy the way, Lucceius fears may impair the public credit. ¹4· 1 agree with yon as to
the ‘secret' you mention. You will not hear from Quintus for some time, owing
