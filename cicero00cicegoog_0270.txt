more natural order oi the words according
to our notions would be ‘meque esse lac·
turum non modo ut tu id sentias sed ut.’
Cicero probably meant that he would
either record the services oi Lentulus in
as cial work (Miiller), or mention them
in is speeehes upon all occasions.

versation'

8. si licitum esset, ie. is no tribune
interposed his veto.

9. sortiturum, ‘would cast lots with
his collengne’ sor the two consular pro·
vinces. This was the regular course: and
this passage seems to imply that it could
only be taken aiter the enactment ol a
‘Lex Curiata·

approval by the ‘curiae' had long become
a mere torm, and its only importanoe was
that the tribunes could interiere with
public business by opposing its enactment.

taieln, on 81 ne, refers to this passage
as showing that the ch Cornelia dr'd
grant such dispensation. The passage
quoted (from Ad Att. 4. 18, a) in a note
on Ep. 28, 7, however, goes rather against
this view. It would appear a sair inier-
ence t'rom this passage that the ‘Lex
Curiata' need not be proposed ior a
magistrate until he was on the point oi
departing sor his province aster, or to-
wards the close oi, his year oi office at
Rome. But Mommsen (Staatsrecht, l,

Becker (Ram. Alterth. a. a, 62 ; 63) thinks
that ‘imperinm’ was usually conierrcd on
the consuls lor their year oi office, either
by anticipation or soon aiter their election,
and that a fresh ‘ Lex Curiata ' was passed
before they departed lor thelr provinces as
