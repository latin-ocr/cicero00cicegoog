Towards the close of the year Caesar, was perhaps dictator for the
third time, with Lepidus for his master of the horse. Cp. Appendix
ro, 4.

Caesar’s force was for some time small, composed in great measure of
raw recruits, and in cavalry especially inferior to the enemy ¹. The
optimates could bring into the field 70,000 regular infantry, composed,
indeed, in great measure of hasty lew'es and emancipated slaves, with an
immense number of cavalry and light troops, and several elephanta sur·
nished by their ally Juba. Nor were capable officers wanting in their
ranks; Afranius, Petreius, and Labienus had all served with distinction ¹ ;
andthe resolute enduranoe of Cato had been recently attested ³. But
the chief command fell, according to constitutional mles, to Scipio, who
was incapable and obstinate⁴; Juba‚ proud of his victory over Curio, set
up pretensions which it was embarrassing either to admit or to resist⁸3
the provincials were harassed by oppression⁸; and the Gaetulians and
Mauretanians' retained a kindly remembrance of Marius, which dis·
posed them to regard with favour the representative of his party.

Still, for some time Caesar’s position was difficolt. In an engagement
fought soon after his landing, the advantage remained with his enemies⁸,
and he was obliged to remain nearly inactive for more than two months.
Gradually, however, his position improved as reinforcements came in
from Sicily ⁹ ; and a diversion made in his favour by P. Sittius‚a Roman
adventures, and by Bocchus of Mauretania ¹⁰, compelled Juba to withdraw
fora time to protect his own dominions. The provincials, too, as far as
they dared, showed their good will to Caesar ¹¹.

At last, early in April, he felt strong enough to rislt a general battle.
The armies met near Thapsus ¹², and Caesar obtained a decisive victory.
His orders to give quarter were disobeyed, and the slaughter was very
great.

Soon after the battle Cato killed himself ¹³ at Utica, and the leaders oi
the defeated party perished almost without exception by their own hands
or by those of the enemy. Scipio, Petreius, Juba‚ Afranius, and Faustus
Sulla none of them long survived Cato ¹⁴. Labienus fled to Spain, and
there co-operated with the sons of Pompey ¹¹⁵.
