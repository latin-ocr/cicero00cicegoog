Puteoli ¹, Sinuessa ¹, Pompeii ⁸, Arpinum ⁴, Antium ³, and other places.
At Antium he had an interview with Brutus and Cassius, and found both
ol them discontented with the commissions proposed for them, and
Cassius very violent ⁸. Cicero was alarmed by Antony's intrigues⁷ with
the veterana settled in Campania, and annoyed by the name Iulius⁸
given to the seventh month. These anxieties did not, however, make
him careless oi his private interest; his affairs seem to have been in a
very disorderly state and this increased his eagerness to get money
owing him, from Dolabella and others, repaid ⁹. Seeing little hope of
doing any good by remaining at Rome, he decided on retiring to
Athens ¹⁰ till the beginning oi the next year. Dolabella bad named him
his legate with peculiar privileges on June 2¹¹, and this gave him apre-
text lor leaving Italy. He was also anxious to see his son, then studying
at Athens, ol whose behaviour unfavourable rumours had reached him ¹¹.

Early in July¹³ he saw M. Brutus at Nesis, where he also heard news ¹⁴
of Sextus Pompeius, who was still in arms. He was much pleased by
the behaviour of his brother Quintus ¹⁶ at this time, and the good under·
standing between them seems not to have been again disturbed.

§ 7. Cicero seems to have embarked about the middle ol July. He
touched at Vibo on the agrd¹⁶‚ and at Syracuse ¹⁷ on August 1. He set
sail next day lor Greece, but was presently driven back by contrary winds
which he encountered off Leucopetra in the territory oi Rhegium. On
landing‚ he heard ¹⁸ that there was a sair prospect that Antony would be
reconciled to Brutus and Cassius, and would renounce the Gallie pro·
vinces. He also read a satisfactory speech ol Antony, and a proclamation
oi Brutus and Cassius, in which they expressed their williugness to retire
lrom Rome in the interest oi public tranquillity. He was not aware
that an angry correspondence ¹⁹ was probably going on at that very time
between Antony and Brutus and Cassius and was eager to return to
Rome in time fora meeting ol the senate announced lor September 1.
A letter from Atticus, reproaching him²⁰ lor deserting his country,
strengthened him in this resolution.

He travelled baclr, accordingly, towards Rome; ameeting with Bnrtus
at Velia²¹, lrom whom he learned that L. Piso had spoken against Antony
in the senate on the first os August, undeceived him as to political pros-
pects, but he persevered and arrived at Rome on August 31 ²².
