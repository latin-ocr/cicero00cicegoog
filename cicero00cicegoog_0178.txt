ere or Arrrcus,

5 1. T. Pomponius Atticus was born apparently about 109 u.c., and
consequently was about three years older than Cicero. He studied with
Cicero, C. Marius the younger, and L. Torquatus, the consul of 65. He
lent money to C. Marius and others. to help them in escaping from Italy.
About 86 or 85 apparently he left Rome, and stayed twenty-two years at
Athens, where his liberality made him generally popular, and the rights
of citizenship were offered him by the Athenians. Atticus declined the
offer, though Cicero speaks of the Atheniens as his fellowcitizens ¹.

When Sulla visited Athens in 84 a. c. he was much pleased with Atticus,
who declined, however, to follow him to Italy.

In 79 nc. Cicero went to Athens and the two friends listened in
company to Antiochus, Phaedrus, and Zeno ².

The length of time which Atticus spent at Athens may account for his
cognomen. He returned to Rome in 65 mc. at Cicero’s request, to
support him in his canvass for the consulship. No letters addressed to
him during the years 64-62 have been preserved, but it does not follow
that he was at Rome ali that time. In December, 63, he induced the
equites to make a demonstration in support of Cicero ⁸—a service for
which his position as a member of an old equestrian family gave him
great advantages. At the end of 62 or beginning of 61 he embarked at
Brundisium for Epirus ⁴.

ξ 2. He declined to attend Quintus Cicero to Asia as his legate, and
was not on very good terms with him, thinking that Quintus did not treat
his sister well (v. infr. ξ 7). Private affairs mainly occupied his thoughts,
buthe seems to have warned Cicero against forming too close an union
with Pompey⁵. He returned to Rome for a few months at the end of
60 s. c.⁶‚ but went back to Epirus in May, 59 ². Cicero frequently begged
him to return. But Atticus stayed in Epirus till November, and when he
returned to Rome, Cicero thought that he did not show sufficient zeal in
his service ⁸. Atticus was liberal, however, both to Cicero and to his
family during the time of his exile, and tried to console him by holding
out hopes of a speedy return, which Cicero hardly shared ⁹. Atticus was
adopted by the will of his uncle about this time, and inherited ten million
sesterces from him ¹⁰. He left Rome about the end of 58, and presently
met Cicero at Dyrrhachium ²¹.
