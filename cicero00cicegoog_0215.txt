1. Ι wish Ι could serve you as effectively as yon serred me: but the money of the
king’s envoys, the hypocritical plea of a religious difficulty, and the eagemess of the
king's friends to serve Pompey are obstacles in my way. a. 1 nm always waming ,
Pompey to bave regard to his own honour, bnt indeed he hardly seems to need any
wamings, and serves you zealously. Marcellinus, you know, has a quarrel with γους
bnt, except ou this question, promises you his support. 3. On Jan. 13 the subject was

general lmpressiou that Pompey would like to be employed. 4 My opinion carries
the less weight with the public, because of my obligations to you, which ere thought
to prejudice me in your favour.
