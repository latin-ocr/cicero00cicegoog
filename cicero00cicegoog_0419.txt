370 M. TULLII CICERONIS [annu 111.

libere inter malos πολιτευτέον fuit aut vel periculose cum bonis;
aut nos temeritatem bonorum sequamuraut audaciam improborum

insectemur. Utrumque periculosum est, at hoc, quod agimus,
turpe, nec tamen tutum. Istum, qui filium Brundisium de pace
5misit-de pace idem sentio, quod tu, simulationem esse apertam,
parari autem bellum acerrime-‚ me legatum iri non arbitror,
cuius adhuc, ut optavi, mentio facta nulla sit: eo minus habeo
⁸ necesse scribere aut etiam cogitare, quid sim facturus, si acci·
derit, ut leger.

69. M. Caelius Rufus to Cicero (Ad Fam. viii. 16).

1. Your letter announcing your probable decision bas filled me with terror. 1
write at once to dissuade you from any hasty step. Yon will bear me witness that
1 wumed yon how Caesar had been imitated by opposition. a. Think of your family3
do not place us who are your friends, though partisuns of Caesar, in an embarrassing
position; do not incur the suspicion of both parties ; do not juin men after defeat
whom you would not join when their prospects were doubtful. 3. Wait, at least, till
you hear what happens in Spain, which Ι believe will very soon be iu Caesar's power.
4. Caesar has begged meto urge you to remam: if l were not obliged to attend him,
1 should bave done all I oonld by personal entreaty to detsin you. 5. lf you cannot
bear tbe tauuts of the optimates and tbe insolence of some of Caesar’s friends, await
the issue of the struggle in some town remote from the seat of war.
