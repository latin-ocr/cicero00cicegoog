vi PREFACE To THE FOURTH EDITION.

the MS. and the making os the early copy, were sor some time
attributed to Petrarch; but the arguments os A. Viertel and
G. Voigt (see reff. p. xxiv) have made it seem almost certain
that Petrarch never knew of the existence os the MS„ or. indeed,
of the letters ‘Ad Familiares· at all.

Other scholars' consider the following MSS. to he independent
us M. 1. The Parisinus (Parisinus Latinus 178¹², Fonds de Notre
Darne 178), referred to as Par. or Ρ, It contains ⁴ Ad Familiares '
1. 1 to 8. 8, 6, ‘impediendi moram.' 2. The Turonensis, con-

* taining *Ad Familiares' 1. 1 tn 7. 32, 1, ‘ me conferri: except the
portion from 2. 16, 4, ‘hac orbis terrarum,¹ to 4. 3. 4, ‘appareat
cum me eo! It is kept, apparently, in the libi-ary at Tours, and
has been collated at Paris sor M. Charles Thurot, who has pub-
lished the collation with comments; assigns the MS. to the
latter part of the twelsth century, and argues that it cannot have
been derived from the Medicean (M.). Both, he thinks, are de-
rived from a common originaL Readings from the Turonensis
are quoted as {rom T. 3. Harleianus 2682 contains Ad Fami—
liares 9-16, apparently only wanting 9. 18 and the fragment
‘ Parmenses miserrimos,¹ which Baiter calls 11. 13b. F. Riihl
(Rhein. Mus. xxx, 1875, pp, 26 and 135) assigns it to the eleventh
century. lt is quoted as H. 4. Harleianus 2773 contains, with
some small gaps, ‘Ad Familiares= 1. 1 to 8. 9, 3 ‘ puto etiarn si
ullam spem' except the portion between 1. 9, 20 ‘exarsi' and
α. ι, 2 ‘dig-nitate es consecutus) Ο. Streicher¹ (p, ¹²9) thinks
that this MS. is closely connected with the Codex Graevii; L.
Mendelssohn (Neue Jahrb. 1884, p. 108) and Mr. Purser (apt
Tyrrell, vol. 11. lix-lxvi) that they are the same. Harl. 2773 is
quoted as B. F. Riihl (Rhein. Mus. 1875, p. 3¹) assigns it to
the twelsth century, but it, as well as H„ is stated in the British
Museum Catalogue to belong to the tenth. 1 owe to the kindness
osa friend a very careful report on the readings of both MSS. in
a number os passages.
