quam solebam, sed aut gravitate valetudinis qua tamen iarn
paulum videor levari, aut quod absim ab urbe, ut, qui ad te
proficiscantur, scire non possim; qua re velim ita statutum
habeas, me tui memoriam curn summa benevolentia teneres
tuasque omnes res non minori mihi curae quam meas esse.

aQuod maiore in varietate versata est adhuc tua causa, quam
homines aut volebant aut opinabantur, mihi crede, non est pro
malis temporum quod moleste ieras; necesse est enim aut armis
urgeri rem publicam sempiternis aut his positis recreari ali- 10

quibus recipieris, vereri debes nec eos, quos adiuvisti; si armis

Cicero refers to the opinion he would have
Torquatus hold, not to the lact.
