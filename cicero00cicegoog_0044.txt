TO THE FIRST PART. 3

tacus, aud Mithridates The war with Sertorius was brought to an end
in 72, that with Spartacus in 7r; but these triumphs 01 the Roman
govemment were followed by dissensions among its supporters.

The only speech delivered by Cicero between the years 75 and 71 nc.
which bas been preserved to us, is that on behals 01 M. Tullius, spoken
apparently in 71¹; but the next year witnessed the memorable prose-
00ῐί00 01 Verres, with which Cicero's political career may be said 10
bave begnn. He was elected curule aedile during the proceedings⁸.

§4 Eight years had elapsed since the death 01 Sulla, and no alter·
ations 01 importance had been made in his institutions: the tribunes
01 the people were still deprived 01 111011 old power 01 initiating legisla-
tion ; the courts 01 criminal justice were still exclusively composed 01
senators3 and the appointment 01 censors had been discontinued 101
several years. Moreover‚ many important cities in Italy were still
occupied by his military colonists; and their old inhabitants, with many
others, were suffering from the effecta 01 his proscriptions and confis-
cations. Nor had the efforts 01 1110 0000131 party to effect a counter
revolution by arms been successful. Yet the aspect 01 affairs can
have given little satisfaction to the more far-sighted members 01 the

victorious party. Sulla had attempted to establish the supremacy os '

the senate both over the people and over 311 public officers; and his
constitution required, 101 its successful working, wisdom and firmness on
the part 01 the governing body, and obedience and sels-sacrifice on the
part 01 1110 highest civil and military officers. Now, there seem to have
been lew men in the senate 01 1031 soresight, even as to the interests
01 their own order 3 the majority were selfish‚ and, 11 001 themselves
criminal, inclined to look with indulgence on crimes committed by
· members 01 111011 own body ⁸. And high officers were little inclined to
respect either the letter or the spirit 01 the constitution. Usage required
that a provincial governor should be, or should have been, consul or
praet0r; but Pompey, without having held either office, advanced a claim
successfully sor the govemment 01 000 01 1110 Spanish provinces. '
Further‚ a minority in the senate had never approved the violent
mensures 01 Sulla. The equites were, probably, exasperated by the
loss 01 their control 01 the conrts 01 criminal justice. The exclusiveness
011110 govemment drove men like Cicero into the ranks 01 the oppo-
sition. Many Italian communities, especially in Etruria, had suffered
loss 01 lands, or 01 10131 franchises, at the hands 01 Sulla, and the
inhabitants 01 such places must either have gone to Rome to swell
the turbulent and needy population 01 1110 0301131, 01 have formed a
dangerous clement 10 the country districts, where their ranks were
