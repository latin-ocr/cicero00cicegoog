to have made a painlul impression; aknight named D. Laberius, known
as a writer ol iarces, was obliged to represent a character in one ol his
own¹ pleces on the stage.

The election ol consuls lor 44 nc. was marked, according to Cicero,
by perfidy to Dolabella ², who had been led by Caesar to hope lor the
consulship, but ior whom Caesar substituted himself. Dolabella’s elec-
tion would have been a violation ol the ‘Leges Annales ¹,' but Cicero
does not notice this.

ξ 13. The earliest months ol this year were employed by Caesar,
now consul lor the filth time and dictator sor the fourth, in preparations
lor an expedition against the Parthians ⁴. He had formed a considerable
camp in Macedonia ¹, and had sent the young Octavius to Apollonia,
probably that he might become acquainted with the soldiers, while pur-
suing his studies.

Meanwhile the conspiracy was being lormed which proved latal to
Caesar. Both the old parties in the State were represented among the
conspirators. C. Cassius and M. Brutus had both served under Pom-
pey¹; D. Brutus and C. Trebonius had been active on behals ol
Caesar⁷. Seneca remarks ¹, ‘Divum Iulium plures amici coniecerunt
quam inimici! Two leelings probably animated the Caesarian members
ol the conspiracy: jealousy ol such ol their comrades as enjoyed a
larger measure ol their leader’s favour, and apprehension that Caesar
might assume the title ol king. The increasing haughtiness ol his
demeanour strengthened suspicion; and the royal title was to the
Romans ol this period associated with oriental despohsm'. M. Brutus
probably believed that he was acting in the public interest. C. Cassius
is said to have been jealous ol the lavour shown to M. Brutus by Caesar.
Both the two last-mentioned conspirators held office under Caesar as
praetors when they conspired against him ¹⁰.

ξ ι4. Early in the year Caesar's statue ¹¹ on the Rostra was decorated
by some officious friend with a laurel crown bound with a ribbon. The
tribunes Flavus and Marullus removed the crown, and though Caesar
took no measures against them he was annoyed. Somewhat later ¹¹, as
he was returning on Jan. 26 lrom celebrating the ‘Feriae Latinae,' he
