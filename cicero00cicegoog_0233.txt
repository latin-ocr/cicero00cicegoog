M. TULLII CICERONIS [rear 11.

26. Τ o P. Lentulus Spinther (Ad Fam. i. 7).

Rouu, Mar oa Juur (l), 5⁶ s. c. (698 suc.)

1. 1 am glad you are ratisfied with my conduct towards you, and pleased with my
letters. a. lt is difficult to describe how individuale behave towards you; but you
bave many jcalous rivals, as 1 had Hortensius, Lucullus, aud Ι, Racilius are among
your warmest irieuds. 3. Pompey was not in the senate when your affairs were under
consideration; your recent letter to him has done much to promote a good under·
standing between you, and 4. γοα may consider what 1 write to have his sanction. We
suggest, then, that you should go to Alexandria with a proper iorce, aud secure aud
peciiy Egypt; the king could theu retum, aud a breach oi the senate's decrees would
be avoided. 5. We think, however, that you should not attempt this without a sure
prospect oi success; aud you cau judge better thau wc cau oi the probabilities ol the
case. 6. Il you think this plau dangerous, there maybe another way; but you will be
best able to judgc. 7. 1 thunk you ior your cougratulations on my present position,
to my attainmcnt ol which you have so largely contributed; but you must know that
the perversity oi certain nobles has compelled me to change my policy. 8. They
treat you no better3 and this shows me that it has not been simply as au upstart that
lhave met with so much envy. 9. 1 entreat you to devote yoursell to that pursuit ol
glory which you have so long followed, great things are expected ol you, aud 1 hope
that iu your provincial administration γοα will have regard to your future position at
Rome. 10. In politica a violent, but unequal, struggle is going on; thc mistakea oi
the optimates have made the side which has might seem to have right also. The
renate has granted Caesar all his requests. ldo not dwell ou this uupleasant topic,
but mention it, that you may combine cantion with independeuoe. 11. Ithank you
ior your cougratulations ou my daughter’s engagement. Your sou is everything you
mu wish, aud 1 hope you will train him to resemble his father.
