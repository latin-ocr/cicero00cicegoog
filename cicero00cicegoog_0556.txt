Antony returned to Rome¹ about the middle of November. He
left the greater part of his troops at Tibur, but brought an escort into
the capital. Having heard of the open mutiny ol the Martian legion he
summoned the senate lor a meeting on the 28th¹, when he probably
intended to ask its sanction for decisive measures against Octavius. But
he heard during the sitting that the fourth legion had followed the example
of the Martian³‚ and contented himself with procuring a vote in honour
of Lepidus ⁴, and with making provision, with the apparent approval of
the senate, lor the govemment ol the provinces during the year⁵ 43 nc.
The most important nomination was that of his brother Gaius to super-
sede M. Brutus in Macedonia. Antony then retired to Tibur ⁶, where an
attempt at mediation was made by several senators who attended him to
his quarters, but failed, owing to the opposition of his brother Lucius ⁷.
He then set out lor Cisalpine Gaul at the head ol a large force ⁸. D.
Brutus prepared to resist⁹ him, but was obliged to evacuate one town
alter another, and finally was besieged in Mutina.

ς ιο. Octavius meanwhile had raised a considerable force of veterans
iu Campania; during Antony's absence he approached Rome, and on
the invitation of the tribune Cannutius he entered the city and addressed
the people‚ professing his readiness to oppose Antony. The Martian
legion had occupied Alba for him3 and he named Arretium as the
guthering-place for his followers ¹⁰.

Cicero seems not to have appeared in Rome between the middle ol
October and the 9th of December ¹¹: he employed himself in composing
a reply¹² to Antony's artaek ol September 19. This reply, the second
Philippis, alter being submitted to Atticus for criticism, was probably
published alter Antony had left Rome. Cicero was not satisfied with the
demeanour of Octavius ¹³, and wrote to several provincial governors ¹⁴ to
confirm thern in their allegiance to the senate. His leisure was occupied
in the composition of philosophical¹⁶ works‚ as it ‘had been earlier in
the year. On December ιο, however ¹⁸, an opportunity presented itself
to him for resuming his duties as a senator. The new tribunes of the
people had then come into office, and convoked the senate on that day

to take steps for securing the freedom ol its deliberations on January 1.
