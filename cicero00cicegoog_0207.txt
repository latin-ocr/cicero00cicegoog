least the neutrality of the consul Paulus by a hnbe of ¹500 taknts, aud
the active support of Curio bya stssl larger oue. Hence. when it was
proposed in the senate³ that Caesar should be required to lay down his
command, Curio praised the propos-al but suggested, amid great ap-
plause, that a similar demand should be addressed to Pompey‘. The
discussion began, apparently, ou or soon after March r ³, but, owing to
the interposition of Curio, the senate carue to no decision‘. Nor were
the optimates more successful when the measmes to be adopted against
Curio were discussed soon afterwards ². Towards the close of the year,
shortly before the tribunes went out of office, the senate adopted, by au
immense majority, Curio’s proposal that both Pompey aud Caesar should
be required to lay down their commands; but the consul Marcellus
angrily declared the sitting at an end-apparently before a formal decree
bad been passed ⁸. Presently afterwards a mmour reached Rome· that

Under the pretext that meu were wanted for the Parthian war, the
senate required Caesar and Pompey to fumish one legion each for that
service. Pompey required the 15th, which he had lent to Caesar. Thus
Caesar was rather unfairly deprived of two legions He obeyed, how-
ever, the senate's orders. The two legions were stationed at Capua, but
were not well satished with the transfer ¹¹. Pompey now left Rome
fora tour in central and southern Italy ; during which, as before men·
tioned ¹², he met Cicero.

Curio, after the close of his tribunate, hastened to Caesar at Ravenna,
to lay before him an account of the state of affairs, and returned to
Rome, bearing Caesare final propositis, on Jan. 1¹³, 49 nc. Among
the new tribunes, Q. Cassius Longinus and M. Antonius were devoted
