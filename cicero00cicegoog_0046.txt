had the case gone on, and in which he summed up the evidence at
great length ¹.

During the three following years, 69-67 66, Cicero seems to have
taken little part in politics. In his aedileship he received presents
hom the Siciliam, and applied thern to the public service; an oppor-
tunity 61 winning popular favour which was the more welcome, as
the moderate extent 61 his own sortune prevented his offering the
usual entertainments to the people on a splendid scale ². In 69 66
defended 111. Fonteius on a charge 61 misgovernment in Gaul; and
parts 61 his speech³ diminish our respect lor the spirit he showed in
accusing Verres. The speech on behall 61 A Caecina very likely be-
longs to the same year. ln the next, 68, Cicero lost his father, and
his first cousin Lucius ⁴. His brother Quintus married Pomponia, sister
61 Atticus, about the same time. The earliest 61 Cicero’s letters which
have been preserved date lrorn the same year, but contain little 61
general interest ⁶. The speech Pro Q. Roscio Comoedo was probably
delivered in 68 or 67 nc. Roscius had previously given Cicero lessons
in elocution ⁰.

§ 7. ln the year 67 a. 6., having reached the age required by law 61
candidates lor the praetorship‚ Cicero sued lor that office; and such was
his popularity, that though the comitia were twice adjourned, he was at
the head 61 the poll 66611 three occasions ⁷.

Various measures 61 more or less importance were carried during this
year. C. Cornelius, one 61 the tribunes, proposed and carried lavvs
restricting the powers 61 the senate to grant exemptions from the opera-
tion 61 particular laws, and binding the praetors to publish their edicts
at once 66 coming into office, and to adhere to them⁸. His supporters
behaved with great turbulence. L. Roscius Otho, another-tribune, carried
alaw assigning to the equites special places in the theatre. Cicero was
61 66 equestrian lamily, and, both 66 personal and public grounds, he
approved this measure ⁹, as calculated to draw the equites nearer to the
senate. He also approved 61 6 lar more important law 61 the same
date ¹⁰, that 61 Α. Gabinius commissioning Pompey to act against the
pirates 61 Cilicia with very extensive powers.

The foreign history 61 Rome had been very chequered during the 166
past years. ln October 69 nc, L. Lucullus had gained a splendid
victory over Tigranes 61 Armenia, and had taken Tigranocerta; buthe
was unpopular with his army, and ill-supported by the home govemment.
