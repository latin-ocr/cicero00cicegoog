Cisalpine Gaul, in the year 43 nc.. was a province, bnt most of its inhabitants were
Roman citizens. Cp. A. ll'. Zumpt, Studia Romana, 30-37. Perhaps the term ‘pro
rincia’ was applied to it in a sense intermediate between the older politieal ormilitary
and the later local meaning, as aeems to hare been the ease with Cilicia before 64 nc.

The letter was written either (cp. Ad Att. ιι. 1, 1) with a stylus on ‘tabulae' thiu

slips of wood or ivory covered with wax and folded together with the writing iuraras.

Q. F. a. ¹5 b, 1) with a reed pen aud inlr on papyrus or parchment ln citherease it
was secured by a thread passing round it and scaled. As letters were usually dicmed
to asecretary, the scal was often the only guarantee for genuineness, and was pre·
serred unbrolren: the reoeirer cut the thread when he opened the letter.

The outside address of the letter was very simple (cp. Ad Ata 8. 5, al. The letter
began with a friendly wish from the writer to the receives, ‘salutem dicit,¹ or ‘salutem
plurimam dicit ς’ sometimes simply ‘salutem' These words were generally cripte-saed
by their initial letters. The nse or omission of the full names and titles of the writer
and receirer depended naturally on the degree of formality which the writer wished to
observe.

The greeting was often followed by the words ‘si vales bene est,’ bnt Cicero rarely
uses these words in confidential letters, except to Terentia letters often ended with
the word ‘sale' but this was frequently dispensed with.

There was no regular post at Rome; officials might employ attendants named
‘ statores¹ to carry their letters (cp. Ad Fam. a. 17, 13 2. 19, al, bnt Cieero speaks in
another passage of employing the messengers of the publicani or tax-gatherers, who
would naturally keep up a constant communication between the capital aud the pro-
vinces (cp. Ad Att. 5. 16, 1). Private people had to trust to their own or their friends'
slaves or freedmen; letter-carriers were called ‘tabellarii' Cicero often expresses
apprehensions that his letters may be tampered with—(eg. Ad Att. 1. 13, 13 415,
7), and occasionally disguises his meaning,—writing in Greek or substituting fictitious
for real names (Ad Ait. a. 19, 53 cp. 1. 13, 43 6. 4aud 5). Cp. Siiptle, Einl. 36·38;

‘tabellarius' ‘tabulae'

NOTE D. Ortgw'n os fke collection (ff Cicero's Letfers.

Cicero, writing to Atticus in 44 nc, says that there was no regular collection of his
letters, but that Tiro had collected about sesenty, and that he himself meant to add to
and publish them. Ad Att. 16. 5, 5. Perhaps the letters ad Familiares and Ad
Quintum Fratrem were published by Tiro, having been procured in part from copies

The letters to Atticus were probably published either by Atticus himself or after his
