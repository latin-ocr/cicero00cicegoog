Oi Cicero's other speeches of this date, that¹ delivered in the senate
on behalf oi M. Crassus must have possessed much political interest.
The consuls and other eminent senators attacked Crassus, probably sor
his measures' against the Parthians. The speech still extant on behall ol
Cn. Plancius, Cicero’s old friend and protector in erile, supplies good
illustrations of the proceediugs at a Roman election. Plancius had
been accused ol bribery by another friend ol Cicero, M. Iuventius
Laterensis. Α third, in which Cicero pleaded for the people of Reate
against the people oi Interamna, in a case relating to the management
oi the course ol the Velinus, shows that a friendly connection was still³
maintained between Cicero and the people oi Reate.

ξ 11. The letters belonging to this year are—several in the Fourth
Book to Atticus, and in the end ol the Second and beginning oi the
Third Book to his brother Quintus, with various others, os which the
most interesting are—a laboured⁴ delence ol his recent political
conduct, and a recommendation⁶ ol a friend to Caesar.

Quintus Cicero seems, at the beginning of this year, to have traus-
lerred his services lrom Pompey to Caesar‘, apparently without opposi-
tion from Pompey. He became one of Caesar's most efficient officers,
and his presence was a security lor his brother’s good behaviour. The
general tone oi the letters ol Marcus to Quintus at this time is one
of great political despondency, and he repeatedly warns his brother

to be cautious in writing⁷. He feared the possible results os an inter·
regnum, followedby a dictatorship3 expressed interest in Messalla, as
a candidate sor the consulship sor 53 ac.. and in Milo lor 52 ⁸, though
regretting the latter’s extravagance and estrangement from Pompey.

He received a letter ol Caesar's⁹ from Britain, and expressed generally
great regard sor him, and admiration lor the finnness with which he bore
his daughter’s¹⁰ loss

Cicero’s leisure was occupied to a great extent in the composition
ol the six books on the ¹¹ Commonwealth, which we possess in a hag-
mentary state. A poem, in ¹² three books, on his exile and return, may
also belong to this year, and he addressed another ¹⁸ to Caesar on his
victories in Gaul.

The political corruption now prevailing at Rome was illustrated
hythe proceediugs ol the candidates for the consulship in this year,
two os whom rnade a scandalous bargain with the actual consuls, which
