a large majority, in spite ol the support which both Caesar and Crassus
are said to have given to Catiline and C. Antonius. Antonius was
elected by a small majority over Catiline ¹.

§o Ciccro had now attained the summit ol his desires: he entered
on his consulship Jan. 1, 63 nc. On that day he addressed the senate
against an agrarian law proposed by P. Rullus, and followed up this
speech by one addressed to the people on the same subJect; in which,
however, he did not venture to attack the principle ol an agrarian law,
and spoke with respect ol the Gracchi ¹.

It has been already remarked, that little had been done to remedy the
social distress and disorder which had resulted lrom Sulla’a legislation.
But the restoration ol the old powers ol the tribunate had made an
opening for attempts to relieve it3 and P. Servilius Rullus, one ol the
tribunes lor 64-6313.c.³‚made a proposal for the division ol the state
lands in Campania among the people, and lor the purchase os other
lands lor a similar purpose ⁴. This proposal respected private property,
and might have created a valuable class ol proprietors‚ while relieving
the capital ol its superfluous populationl. But Rullus proposed to
entrust the carrying out of the law to a commission armed with very
extensive powers, os which Pompey should not be a member, and
which should be appointed by a novel mode ol electiori. All these
provisions might give offence; and Cicero’s declamations against the
sormidable powers to be given to the commission‚ and his appeals to
popular jealousy ol Capua, were sufficient to deleat the measure. It is
possible that Rullus may have acted in concert with Caesar and others,
and that the commission may have been intended to form a counterpoise
to the power os Pompey. But such a supposition seems needless to
account for the introduction os a measure thoroughly in accordance with
the policy ol the popular party ⁴.

Cicero also opposed a measure lor removing the political disahilities
which Sulla had imposed on the children ol proscribed persons ⁷. He
