1. Cisalpine Gaul. D. Brutus had been appointed¹ by Caesar to
govern this province, and went there in April, 44 rac.² At the time

oi the siege ol Mutina he seems to have had two legions os old soldiers
and one oi recruits at his disposal, with a numerous body oi gladiators³.
He took the command os Pansa’s new levies alter the death oi their
general, and these with recruits whom he raised himself brought his total
force up to ten legione-ot which, however, Plancus only allows one to
have been composed oi veterans. Four of his legions subsequently
joined Antony, and six Octaviam.

2. Narbonensian Gaul with Hither Spain. M. Lepidus held these
two provinces, but entrusted their government to his legates lor some
timei He had a legion close to Rome at the time oi Caesar's
murder⁷, and four⁸ in Gaul later in the same year. Next year we
find him near Forum Iulii at the head os seven, one being the
famous tenth⁸.

3. Northem Gaul (Gallia Comata). This province, which had
been added to the empire by Caesar, was divided in 44 nc. between
A. Hirtius and L. Munatius Plancus The former, however, leit his
district to his officers¹⁰, and in 43 nc. the whole province was apparently
subject to Plancus, who commanded an army of four or five legions
there ¹¹.

4. Farther Spain (Baetica and Lusitania). After the battle ol Munda
Sex. Pompeius retired among the Lacetani, and subsequently raised
forces which he combined with fugitives from the battle. He fought
with some success against P011i0¹¹, but Lepidus¹³ induced him to lay
down his arms, and he retired to Massilia¹⁴ to watch events. During the
