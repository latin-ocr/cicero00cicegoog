prospicere posses; ego, qui festinavi, ut Caesarem in Italia
viderem—sic enirn arbitrabamur—eumque multis honestissimis
viris conservatis redeuntem ad pacem currentem, ut aiunt, inci-

fortasse ego pro mea, tu pro tua, pro sua quisque parte ferre
epotasset, si auctor adfuisset. Qua re velim pro tua perpetua
erga me benevolentia scribas ad me, quid videas, quid sentias,
quid exspectandum, quid agendum nobis existimes. Magni erunt
mihi tuae litterae; atque utinam primis illis, quas Luceria ιο
miseras, paruisseml siue ulla enim molestia dignitatem meam

retinuissem.

the licentious conduct of Antouy, partly

ΜΑΥ. 1 had followed Baiter (with
whom Schiita and Billerb agree) in giving
this date. But us no montb is mentioned
iu the letter, and as Ep. 85 seems not to
have been written later than April (see the
introductory note on it), I now think that
the present letter may belong to an earlier
mouth, perhaps March. Drumann (6.
aitrau}‘intaurentur
Jabresbericht, Vol. 38, Part lI, p. 60) to
the very end of 46 nc, after Caesar's
departure for S ain—a date which he
holds to be in icated hythe accounts
given of Cicero’s movements in his letters
to Varro and Paetus in Book IX, ad
Familiares, and in that to M. Marius,
VII, 4. Iu either case lt must have been
written later than Ep. 85. But its con·
teuts are not such as to make the date a
matter of historical importunae.
