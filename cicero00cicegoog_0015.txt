x PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.

a very lively and interesting sketch os Cicero's public and
private lise.

1 have read with great interest some notes by M. Cobet in
Mnemosyne, V11 (1875) on Cice-0¹³ Philippics, the general drist
os which is to show that the friends os Antony were much rnore
influentia! in the senate during the war os Mutina than would he
gathercd by Ἀ hasty readcr os those orations, 1 do not find it
neediul to alter what 1 have said in the Introduction to Part V;
but M. Cobet's remarks deserve to be caresully considered hy
students of the period there referred to,

A paper by Li Gurlitt discussa at some length the nature os
the collection os letters ‘Ad Familiares.¹ He believes that all
the letters written by or to Cicero which we now possess, except
those to Atticus, form part osone single collection made by Tiro.
of which large portioris have perished; that the seventy letters
mentioued Ad Ate. 1⁶* 5, 5 were probably all contained in the
thirteen-nh book ‘Ad Familiares;' and that tlte collection was
probably published aster the final hreach between Antony aud
Octavian, when attacks upon Antony would no longer give
offence to the party dominant in Italy.

11· rny selection os letters 1 have been principally guided by
emrsideration os their historica! importance or os their value as
illustrating Cicero's characteri Notwithstanding the absence os
:my letters os the important year 63 Rc.. and their comparative
'nuncity sor the years 56-52 irc„ Cicero's correspondcnce sur-
nishes, 1 think, the most detailed and trustworthy commentary
on a very interesting period of Roman history, and the matcrials
which it provides sor an estimare of his own character are so
abundant that their very ahundance causes difficulty. His
changing states os mind are so accurately reproduced in his
letters that it is difficult to form a judgmenx with confidencc
as to the motives which had permanentiy most influence with
him.

Among ancient works those which throw most light on the
letters os Cicero are naturally his other works, especially his
speechcs. Though not so trustworthy as his letters with regard
to matters of fact, they are still very valuable both as supple-

enting and as illustrating his correspondence.
§ext in value to these 1 should place the writings of Caesar,
