TO THE FIRSY PART. 11

be committed to eustody, and that Cicero should be honoured by a
‘supplicatio' He addressed¹ the people on the same day, congratu-
lating them on the virtual suppression of the plot. Next day, Dec. 5,
the punishment of the conspirators was discussed in the senate, and,
in spite of the efforts of C. Caesar, a majority voted for their execution.
Cicero supported this course, though not very decidedly, in his fourth
speech against Catiline. The execution took place that evening: Len-
tuluS, Cethegus, and three others, were strangled in a dungeon near the
Capitol ¹.

At an earlier period of the year, Cicero had proposed 3ηά carried
a law' increasing the penalties for bribery and other illegal practices at
elections. Ser. Sulpicius, M. Cato, and others, prosecuted L. Murena,
one of the consuls elect, under this law; but Cicero defended him, and
he was acquitted. The speech is strangely omitted in a list given by
Cicero of those of his consulate ⁴. It was delivered after Catiline's flight
from Romel.

On Dec. 31, one of the new tribunes, Q. Metellus Nepos, prevented
Cicero from addressing the people on going out of office, saying that he
had put Roman citizens to death without trial. Cicero declared, amid
the applause of the people, that he had saved his country ⁶. The incident
was significant, for Metellus was a decided adherent of Pompey.

It is evident that, before the close of his consulship, Cicero had
definitely quitted the popular party; even during his year of office
a change of tone may be noticedt Various causes may have con·
tributed to produce this result; satisfied ambition and the flatteries ⁴
of the leading nobles3 the estrangement of the popular party from
Pompey; and the suspicions under which its leaders lay of complicity
with Catiline. The same causes naturally tended to strengthen the
dominant party in the senate generally.

But Cicero saw that the senate could only maintain its position by
keeping up a good understanding with the equites and with Pompey;
and he worked hard to maintain such an understanding. His letters
sbovv how his exertions were baffled by the selfishness and personal
jealousy of some senators, and by the ill-timed rigour of Carot

C. Octavius, afterwards emperor, was born on Sept. 33 in this year ⁹,
and C. Caesar was elected one of the praetors for 62 sc. He was
also elected pontifex maximus, though Q. Catulus was brought forward
against him¹⁰.
