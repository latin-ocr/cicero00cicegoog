29. To P. Lentulus Spinther (Ad Fam. i. 9).

Rosea, Annuus, 54 nc. (700 auc.)

1. Iwas glad to learn from your letter that yon were satished with my gratitude.
1 should be guilty indeed if 1 failed to do you any servicein my power; andi wishyou
had been present to see how 1 understand my duty. 2. For your own sake 1 am glad
that you now bold a post of high command, but your presence would have enubied us
to act in concert, and to punish our enemies. One of them, however, has saved us
the troubie; his mad atternpts have made him harmiess for the future. 3. Yon have
learned, at less expense than 1 did, how to appreciate the good faith of certain people3
and this brings me to yourenquiries. 4. Yon do not complain of my reconciliation
with Caesar and Appius; but wish to know why 1 pleaded for Vatinius. 1 must reply
by a general exposition of my policy.

After my restoration from exile 1 thought myself peculiarly indebted, not only to
yon but to my country, arrd often expressed my sense of obligation both in public und
in private, 5. though even theu 1 perceived that some who ought to have been active in
securing me compensation for my losses were lukewarm or jaalous ς 6. and though, as
you often said, I was under great obligations to Pompey, 1 adhered to my oid party.
7. ln defeuding Sestius, Ispolre with the greatest freedom in Pompey's presence, 8.
and showed equal lirmness in the senata On April 5, in the year before last, 1 gave
notice of a motion which was a direct attach on the policy of Pompey und Caaar.
This caused great agitation; und 9. Pompey, who at first showed no dispieasure, after
ameeting with Caesar ut Luca, remonstrated energetically with my brother in Sardinia,
aud reminded him of his promises on my behalf. 10. This news from my brother, and
a demand from Pompey that 1 should keep myself unpledged as to the motion above
referred to, made me reiiect whether 1 ought not to think of private as well as of public
duty. And 1 was further iufluenced by the malicious pleasure which some of the op·
timetes took in my estrangement from Pompey, and by the court which they paid to
Clodius. 11. Still, if the leaders of the opposite party had been worthless men, nothing
should have induced me to support them in any degree. But one of them was Pompey,
whose public services had been most eminent; and 1 did not think 1 should be charged

with inconsistency if 1 slightly changed my policy in favour osone to whose support 1 '

had devoted much of my life. rr. Thusl had to regurd Caesar also with favour, as
his cause was bound up with Pompey’s: his old friendship with mc and my brother and
his recent liberality made me all the more disposed for such a course; and 1 thought
that, after his great expioits, a struggle with him would have been mischievous to the
State. Iconsidered myself also pledged to some extent by what had passed between
Caesar, Pompey, and my brother. 1 remembered a saying of Plato, and thought how
it had been verihed in our history, first by the seuate’s behsuiour in the years between
my consulship and Caesar’s, 13. and afterwards iu another way, by the real or affected
alarm of some of my apparent friends. 14 1 am aware that the latter afterwards did
good service to me in procuring my restoration; ¹5· but afterwards they eourted
Clodius, and seemed to wish, by treating my just claims in a niggardly spirit, to prevent
my asserting my independence. 16. In this they were misled by a mistaken inferenoe
from the case of Metellus Numidicus. 17. However, there hus been uo undue as·

sumptpon about my behuviou15 1 only strive to serve such men as may be in need of
my ep.

Annuus. From the language of θ ²5 administration, and perhaps we may infer
of this letter it seems that Appius was that the year of his consulship was draw-
already looking forward tobis provincial ing to its close.
