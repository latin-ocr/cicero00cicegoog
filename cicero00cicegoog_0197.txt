of the Roman arms, and was able to return, as usual, to North Italy for
the winter¹, in order to watch the course of political events. Pompey
was still on good terms with him, and allowed him to form a legion out
of men of Cisalpine Gaul who had taken the military oath of obedience
to Pompey himself ¹.

Cicero was probably little affected by the death of Crassus ⁸, whom he
seems never to have regarded with cordial affection. Crassus’ son
Publius, who perished a day or two before his father, had, however,
always shown great respect for Cicero ⁴, who was chosen to fill the
place in the college of augurs which had become vacant by Publius’
death ⁶.

Cicero was much interested in Milo's prospects as a consular caudi·
date, and recommended him to Curiof. But this year, like its prede·
cessor, closed without any election of consuls having been made, and
was followed by an interregnum.

Atticus seems to have spent the year at Rome, otherwise we should
hardly be without some letters to him. Cicero's main correspondents
at this time were the younger Curio ⁷, now quaestor in Asia, and C. ι
Trebatius Testa ⁸, a lawyer who had gone, with Cicero's recommenda-
tion, to push his fortunes iu Caesar's camp.

the partisans⁰ of the consular candidates, P. Plautius Hypsaeus, T. An·
nius Milo, and Q. Metellus Scipio, were all active. P. Clodius wasa
candidate for the praetorship, but was killed by Milo's retinue in an
affray near Bovillae ¹⁰ on Jan. 17 or 18. Much rioting followed, and the
senate-house was bumt at Clodius' funeral. Milo did not renounce his
hopes of the consulship: but to stop the violence which still prevailed,
the senate, at the suggestion of M. Bibulus, proposed that Pompey
should he appointed sole consul. This election took place on the a4th
of an intercalary month, inserted between February and March. Pompey
was created consul ‘absens et solus quod nulli alii umquam contigit ¹¹,'
and became virtually dictator. Nor was he required to lay down his
govemmcnt of Spain, which was administered by his legates. He could
not vish fora more exalted position, and a growing estrangement may
now be traced between him and Caesar, whose alliance he no longer
thought necessary. Pompey refused Caesar’s proposal of a new mar·
