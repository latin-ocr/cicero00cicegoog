TO THE FOURYH PART. 399

to escape ¹. Resistance now ceased. Caesar made Cleopatra queen of
Egypt, detained Arsinoe as a prisoner, and departed in July¹ for Asia,
where the successes of Pharnaces demanded his presence. That prince,
son of the famous Mithridates, had defeated⁸ Cn. Domitius Calvinus,
whom Caesar had left in charge of Asia Minor. But Caesar obtained a
decisive success on August 2 at Zela in Pontus, and after making pro·
vision for the govemment of Asia, landed in September at Tarentum ⁴.

ς 4. In Illyricum the fortune of war had been variable. After the
battle of Pharsalus, Caesar had left Q. Cornificius there with two legions,
and that army was subsequently re-inforced by Cicero's old enemy,
A. Gabinius. The latter suffered some reverses at the hands of the Dal·
manans, and afterwards died of fatigue and vexation. M. Octavius, who
commanded a naval force in the Adriatic for the optimates, attempted
subsequently, in conjunctiou with the natives, to occupy the province,
but was baffled by the energy of P. Vatinius ⁸, who fitted out a naval
force hastily at Brundisium and defeated Octavius. Thus the pro·
vince remained in the hands of Comilicius, and Octavius sailed to
Africa, whither many of the leaders of the optimates had already betaken
themselves.

Among them were Cn. Pompeius the younger, Metellus Scipio,
Afranius, Petreius, Faustus Sulla, and Labienus. Catu, too, carried
a body of troops by sea from Corcyra to Cyrene, and thence led
them by 3 toilsome march to the province of Africa ⁰. At his sug·
gestion, Cn. Pompeius retired to Mauretania, and thence to the Balearic
islands and to Spain, to talre advantage of the disaffection which had
been caused there by the misgovernment and dissensions of Caesar’s
officers⁷.

§ 5. Italy had been disturbed during these months. When the news
of Pompeys death reached Rome, the senate voted that Caesar, em-
powered to deal according to his own pleasure with members of the cou- ’
quered party, and to make peace and war on his own authority, should
be named dictator for a year, and should have power to name the curule
magistrates for several years in advance ⁸. M. Antonius, who had landed
with some troops for the defence of Italy, was named his master of the
horse rather irregularly, for it was usual for the dictator to name his own
master of the horse, and there was no time to send to Caesar at Alex·
andria ⁹. Antony was thus again entrusted with the govemment of
