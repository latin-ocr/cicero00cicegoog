The revenue was in an unsatisfactory state, and ill able to meet the
heavy demands made upon it ior the supply of corn to the capital,
and for the pay of Caesar’s army. Now a considerable income had
been sacrifiocd by the allotment ol the Campanian domain under the
agrarian 1333ι ol 59 nc, and Cicero, on April 5, proposed that the
senate should, on May 15, discuss the legality ol such allotment. No
doubt the object ol this motion was the repeal ol' the laws ol 59, 3ηά
it was thus a direct challenge to Caesar. Itis probable that Cicero
hoped too much from 3 suspected estrangement ol Pompey t'rom
Caesar. The conductos the former, with respect both to the proposal
oi Messius ¹, and to the restoration ol Ptolemy⁸, betrayed eagemess to
obtain an important military command ; 3ηά he was probably jealous
ol Caesar. Thus Cicero seems not to have been surprised when, at an
interview shortly alter his own proposal had been made in the senate,
Pompey shewed⁴ no sign ol displeasure. But he failed to consider
that the agrarian laws ol 59 had been as much Pompey’s work as
Caesar's3 that the lriendship ol those two leaders was secured bya
marriage connection; and that several ol the optimates (especially
Favonius, M. Bibulus, and Curio) disliked Pompey, and would not
abstain lrom their ofsensive patronage os Clodius

Caesar, probably wamed os the state ol affairs at Rome, had lest his
Transalpine province and was now at Ravenna, where Crassus ⁸, among
others, waited on him. The result oi their representatione seems to have
been that Caesar was much incensed against Cicero, and probably some-
what disturbed by the doubtlul behaviour ol Pompey. The latter, how·
ever, would not submit to so decided an attach on his past policy as
that made by Cicero's motion. He left Rome lor a visit to Sardinia and
Africa, and, on his way to one ol the northern ports ol Italy, had acon·
lerence with Caesar at Luca. Many senators 3ηά men holding high
office were drawn to the place by this important meeting.

§a Both Pompey and Caesar had reason to wish lora re·establish-
ment ol friendly relations. Pompey, unable to conduct affairs at Rome
by himself, had to choose between a reconstruction ol the triumvirate
and a surrender to the optimates, who had shown little consideration ior
him. As lor Caesar, his provincial government would expire in March,

54 s.c.; he would then have either to resign it or to declare war on the
government. The conquest os Gaul was not completed, and it was
probably doubtful il, without Pompey's aid, he could get his govern-
ment prolonged. An understanding between the two leaders was soon
arrived at, and its objects seem to have been two; to check the rising
spirit ol independence in the capital and in Italy, and to secure the
