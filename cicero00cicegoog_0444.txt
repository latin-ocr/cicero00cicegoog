1. Ibave received three letters from yon. I hope you will aid my family in their
difficulties 1 have bad nothing 1ο write about, as 1 do not approve of our measures,
and take no part in direeting them. Would that 1 had conferred with you 111 person
before leaving Italy!

1. Isidorus will tell you the news; the rest 01 our task seems equally easy. I hope
you will attend to what especially interestis me. Iam far from well; if 1 get better
I shall join Pompey, who is very sanguine. Brutus is doing what besan for us.
Consider well what should be done about the ‘second payment.’
