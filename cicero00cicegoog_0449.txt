⁴00 INTRODUCTION

112151, as in 49 Β. c. He seems to have abstaiued from acts ot* eruelty,
and treated Cicero in particular with much oensidemtiun¹; but the
mensures of desence which he had to adopt were probably burdensome
ω never-al towns, urhis we may believe Cioero,his licentioumesu and
arrogance caused genera-l disgunt ¹.

No ordinary curule magistrates were elected for the year ⁴⁷ s. c.
till towards its close. P. Dolabella, now tdbune‘, raised an agita-
tion' in favour os an nbolition of deins, which threatened to become
serious, but was ehecked by Antnny, who introduced a body os troops
imo the capital and daughtered Soo os the rioters. The usitatiori

philosophical and rhetorical treatises.

He used his influence, however, eagerly on behals os his sn'ends ¹¹ in
