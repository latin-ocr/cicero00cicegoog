PART ΙΙ.

20. To Atticus (Ad. Att. iv. ι).

Romu, Snrrrrannn, 57 a. c. (⁶97 auci

1. Ι write immediately aiter my return, to say that, while Ι think Ι had previously
some reason to complain, your late services have made me ample amends: a. and 1
wish you were here to share my satisfaction. In future 1 will make up ior past neglect.
3. 1 have regained my oid position to a greater extent than 1 could have hoped, but
my property has been seriously impaired. 4. ilet't Dyrrhachium on August 4, and
arrived next day at Brundisium, where Tullia met me, and I presently learned that the
law ior my recall had been carried. Both at Brundisium and along the road to Rome
1 received the warmert congratulations irom every one, 5. and on my arrival literally
every oneos the slightest importance came to meet me, while the parts oi the city
through which 1 passed to the Capitol were thronged by a vast multitude. Next day,
Sept. 5, Ι returned thanirs to the senate. 6. Two days afterwards there were disorders,
caused by the deamess oi corn. Ι suggested, in accordance with Pompey's known
wishes, that he should be entmsted with a commission to supply it3 and the senate
passed a decree to that effect. Ithen addressed the people. 7. Next day, in a full
senate, a bill was drawn up giving Pompey the management oi the supply oi corn ior
tive years, with power to name fifteen legates, oi whom he named me first. Messius
proposed that he should have stiil more ample powers. The way in which 1 shall re·
oeive compensation ior my house wili depend on the jndgment oi the pontifices. 8. Yon
aee my position. 1 am in difficulties, as yon know, about my property, and have some
tanny troubles which Ι do not mention. My brother is most devoted to me. Pray
come rpeedily; romeos those who iateiy aerved meare already beginning to iali
away.
