received an unreasonable letter¹ from Q. Metellus Celer, governor of
Cisalpine Gaul, complaining of his behaviour to Metellus Nepos.
Cicero's reply² was a temperate and dignified expostulation, showing
that he had not been the aggressor.

The two Metelli were probably brothers ³. Q. Metellus Celer, praetor
in ⁶3 s.c., and afterwards governor of Cisalpine Gaul, had contributed,
as has been said ⁴, to the suppression of Catiline's rebellion. He was
generally on good terms with Cicero, but was a more uncompromising
politician, being a deterrnined member of the party of the optimates, and
not inclined to malre concessions either to the equites or to Pompey.
He married a sister of P. Clodius, niclrnamed Quadrantaria; was consul
in 60 s. c.‚ and died next year, as some believed, poisoned by his wife ⁵.

Q. Metellus Nepos, tribune in 63—62 s.c., has been already men·
tioned⁸. He subsequently gave up his quarrel with Cicero, and pro·
moted, as consul, his restoration from exile in 57 ⁷.

Towards the close⁸ of the year, it was generally believed that P.
Clodius had been detected in the house ol C. Caesar while the yearly
sacrifice to the Bona Dea was going on, prompted‚ it was supposed,
by a passion for Caesar's wife Pompeia. Caesar refused to take any
steps against Clodius, but divoreed Pompeia, saying his wife must be
‘above suspicion ⁹.'

A law proposed by the consuls (Lex Iunia Licinia) provided for
proper publicity in the registration ol laws-‘ ne leges clam in aerarium

ξ 14. The new consuls were M. Pupius Piso and M. Valerius Messalla.
Cicero was satisfied with Messalla, but not with his colleague, who
slighted him iu the senate, and opposed a motion for enquiry into
the scandalous affair of Clodius ¹¹. Cicero seems to have been rather
despondent as to the issue of that transaction, and relaxed his own
exertions ¹².

He also suspected Pompey of jealousy and insincerity ¹³. It was from
the camp of that general that Metellus Nepos had come to Rome to sue
for the tribuneship; and, as has been mentioned ¹⁴, Metellus toolr refuge
with Pompey when suspended by the senate. Pompey lingered need-
lessly in Asia, and when he landed in Italy (Jan. 61 uc.) order had
