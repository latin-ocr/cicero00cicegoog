§ 12. Catiline, on hearing of the execution of his accomplices, had
attempted to malie his way into Cisalpine Gaul, with the forces which
his partisan Manlius had collected at Faesulae. But Metellus Celer was
prepared to meet him, and he accordingly turned upon the consul
C. Antonius. A desperate battle followed, iu which the loyal forces
under M. Petreius, legate of Antonius, destroyed the rebels Catiline
himself fell ¹. Many men were brought to trial at Rome as his accom-
plices, and Cicero defended one of them, P. Sulla. He also spoke in
the senate in defence of his late colleaguc, C. Antonius; and, in a court
presided over by his brother Quintus, defended the claim of the poet
Archias to Roman citizenship, which had been questioned ¹.

Q. Cicero and C. Caesar were among the praetors. By the advice,

probably, of the latter, the popular party seems to have sought a recon-
ciliation with Pompey. Caesar proposed to transfer to him from Q.
Catulus the dedication of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus⁸‚ but without

success ; and attempts made by Caesar, and by the tribune Metellus
Nepos, to procure a popular vote entrusting Pompey with the command
against Catiline, failed also, principally owing to the energetic resistance
of Cato. Much rioting, however, followed; and both Metellus and
Caesar were suspended from their fonctions by the senate. Nepos
fled to the camp of Pompey; but Caesar, by a judicious mixture of
deference and firmness, induced the senate to re·instate him in his
office. He was soon afterwards denounced by L. Vettius and Q. Curius
as an accomplice of Catiline3 but Cicero declared the charge to be
groundless, aud its authors were disgraced or punished ⁴.

Cicero bought a large house on the Palatine from M. Crassus, for
which he paid about §ganno (XXXVHS.) He had to borrow large
sums of money from P. Sulla and from ‘Teucris ⁵‚' and, in aletter⁴ to
P. Sestius, said that he would rather J'oin in a conspiracy than suppress
one, as he owed so much money.

ξ 13· The series of his letters begins anew, after a considerable in-
terval, with one written to Pompey early in this year. Cicero had already
sent him a detailed account of his consulship, and was vexed at receiving
in reply what he thought an insufficient acknowledgment of his public
services. Thia vexation is expressed franldy enough in a second letter⁷;
the first and longer one has been lost. About the same time Cicero
