1223] ΑΙ) QUINT. FRA T. II. 3. 173

consecuti, ut nequid agi cum populo aut salvis auspiciis aut salvis
legibus aut denique sine vi posset. De his rebus pridie, quam
haec scripsi, senatus auctoritas gravissima intercessit; cui cum
Cato et Caninius intercessissent, tamen est perscripta: earn ad
te missam esse arbitror. De ceteris rebus, quicquid erit actum,5
scribam ad te, et, ut quam rectissime agatur, omni mea cura,
opera, diligentia, gratia providebo.

Roas, Fra. 15, 56 rac. (698 auc.)

r. The audieaces to foreign euroys have been postponed, and C. Cato has proposed
to pat an eud to the govemmeut of lentulus. a. Milo appeared on the aud, and again
on the 7th; Pompey wished to spealr iu his defeaee, but the uproar raised by Clodius’
partisans drowued his voice, and a scene of riot and confusion followed. 3. Onthe9th
the renate passed a resolution censuring some of these proceediugs. C. Cato praised
rne, while inveighing against Pompey; and the latter, in replying to him, attached
Crassus and said he would take care of his own life. 4 1 understand from Pompey
that Crassus and others are supporting Clodius and C. Cato against him. He is pre·
paring for defeuoe, and many people will come from the country, both to support him
and to oppose C. Cato’s attacks upou Lentulus and Milo. 5. 1 have promised my
support to Sestius, who has been indicted both for bribery and for riot. The senate is
trying to checlr popular corruption 6. On Feb. 11, 1 defended Bestia, and took the
opportunity of saying something in praise of Sestius. 7. Thus far 1 wrote on Feb. 12.
My position is influential, aad 1 owe it in great measure to your devotion. 1 have hired
you a house, but hope your own will be ready in a few mouths. Good tenants hare
taken that iu the Carinae. Ihave not had a letter ainue that yon wrote from Olbia.
Be carefrd of your health, and remember that you are in Sardinia.
