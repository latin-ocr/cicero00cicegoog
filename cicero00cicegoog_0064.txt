directing the consuls to propose a law for his recall ¹. This decree was
passed apparently in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus.

3. One passed on the day following, which contained expressions
of gratitudo to all who had come to Rome for the sake of supporting
Cicero's recall; threats against any who should binder the passing of
a law in his favour¹3 and an invitation to himself to return if such a law
did not pass within five days ⁸. On this occasion the consul Metellus
Nepos declared himself reconciled to Cicero ⁴.

This decree perhaps passed¹ on August 4, on which day a law for
Cicero's recall was sanctioned by the comitia centuriata ⁶. Milo, who
had already indicted Clodius for riot, brought armed men into the Forum
to protect the voters from disturbance ¹.

§²4- Cicero lest Dyrrhachium, where he had been since the end of
November, 58 s.c.‚ on the very day on which the law passed. He
lauded next day at Brundisium, where he found Tullia awaiting his
arrival; and, on the 8th, heard from his brother Quintus that the law for
his restoration had passed. He then travelled to Rome, receiving every·
where a warm greeting and reached the capital on Sept. 4. He was
enthusiastically welcomed and next day addressed the senate, thanking
them for his recall, possibly in the speech which we now possess ¹.

Only three of his letters belong to the first eight months of 57 uc. ;
two to Atticus, one¹ apparently written about the middle of January,
saying that he would return ou the strength of the senate's expression of
opinion, even if anything prevented the passing of a law 3 the other ¹⁰, an
outburst of utter despair after the events of Jan. 23 were known to him.
The third ¹¹ was to the consul Metellus, appealing to him to forget his
private grudges, and promising gratitude.

§²5- The foreign affairs of this year were important. A. Gabinius,
pro-consul of Syria, had to make war on the Jews, who had revolted
against the government of Hyrcanus, which the Romans had set up.
He govemed ably, but was covetous and unscrupulous, and, if Cicero
isto be believed, met with some serious reverses¹¹. His late colleague,
Piso, govemed Macedonia rapaciously and disastrously ¹¹.

Meanwhile Caesar was prosecuting his conquests in Gaul. He re-
duced most of the Belgian tribes to submission, defeating the Nervii
in a great battle. He then sent P. Crassus against some of the north-
westem tribes ¹⁴. .
