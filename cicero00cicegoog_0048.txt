year, but were convicted of bribery, which annulled their electiori. They
then combined with Cn. Piso and L. Sergius Catilina to murder L. Cotta
and L. Torquatus, who had been elected to fill their places. The plot
was to be carried out on Dec. 31 ¹, but failed, owing to some misunder-
standing. Catiline had just returned from governing Africa as pro Ἴ
praetor, and probably feared a prosecution, envoys from the province
having arrived at Rome to complain of his conduct. .

Iu the year 65 s. c., Cicero defended C. Cornelius, the tribune of 67 ἣ
and perhaps delivered the speech ‘de rege Alexandrino' of which some
fragments have been preserved ³. Having declined the administration
of a province as propraetor⁴, he began to prosecute his canvass for
the consulship, which, however, he could not legally hold till 63 ⁶. The
election for 64 resulted in favour of L. lulius Caesar, maternal uncle of
lll. Antonius, the triumvir, and of C. Marcius Figulus ⁸. Cicero mentions
among his own antagonists, Catiline, C. Antonius, and two more respect·
able men, P. Galba and Q. Cornificius. He begged Atticus, who was then
at Athens, to come to Rome to help him in his canvass, and to do all he
could lor him with the friends of Pompey⁷. Nor did he shrink from more
questionable electioneering manoeuvres For he thought of defending
Catiline, of whose guilt he had no doubt, on acharge of extortion; hoping
that, if acquitted, he would coalesce with his advocate⁸. Opinions differed,
even among writers living within a century of Cicero's death, whether he
actually defended Catiline or not ⁹. Moreover‚ he declined to support
Caecilius, uncle of Atticus in a just suit against one Caninius Satyrus,
out of regard both for Caninius himself, and for his powersul friend
L. Domitius ¹⁰. Catiline was acquitted, owing to the corruption of the
judges and the treachery of his accuser, P. Clodius¹¹.

Cicero's son Marcus was bomon the day of election ol consuls for
64 u. c.¹² Atticus, in compliance with Cicero’s request, returned to Rome
from AthenS, where he had lived 22 years ¹³.

In the next year, 64 rac, Cicero's attention must have been mainly
occupied by his canvass for the consulship. We have no letters of this
date, nor does he seem to have made any remarkable speeches, with the
exception of that ‘in toga candida‚' which we possess in fragments. It
contained a violent attack on Catiline. Atticus seems to have been at

Rome throughout the year.
It must have been about this time that Cicero received from his brother

Quintus the letter ‘de Petitione Consulatus! He was elected consul by
