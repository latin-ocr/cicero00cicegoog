ADDJTJONS AND CORRECTIONS. 671

adictator, or a consul invested with special powers by the ‘senatus consultum
ultimum' could be called to account for his acta, though he thinks that after
the yesr 300 ne. the decisions of all magistrates whatever were subject to
appeal-‘lhe author of the article on ⁴ Cicero’ in the Quarterly Review for
October 1880 doubts the legality but strongly asserta the expediency of the
execution and Cicero’s honesty in ordering 11 Μ1. W. E. Heitland (in an
edition of Cicero's speech ‘pro C. Rabirio perduellionis reo,‘ Cambridge, 1882)
maintains that au execution ordered by a consul authorized by the ‘senatus
consultum nltimnm' would not be strictly legal, bnt would be constitutional,
having regard to usage. See Appendix A, pp. 87-88, in his work. Lange,
Rom. Alt I. ⁶15(2nd edition), 11. 383 (ist edition), takes snbstantially the
same view. Madvig (Verfassung und Verwaltung des Rdmischen staats, Band
1. pp. 300-303) speaks of the execution as only justified by necessity, but does
not, l think, absolutely desine the legal force of the ‘s c. ultimum! A. W.
Zumpt (Criminalrecht der Rom. Republik‚ Band 1. Abth. a, pp. 411-415)
appears to regard the execution of the conspirators as strictly legal, on the
ground that they were either caught in the act of treason, or convicted by their
own confession ; but thinks that it was inconsistent with the prerailing political
doctrine.
