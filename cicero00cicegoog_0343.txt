NOTE F. On the Commissrbn granted to Pomm r'a September 57 B.C.
Cp. supra, pp. 1373 1643 ¹⁶53 168; 176.

The following words in Ep. 21, 3 ‘Cmssns tres legatos daeemit nec excludit Pom-
peium: censet eninr etiam ex iis qui cnm imperio sint,' seem to imply that Pompey was
possessedof ‘ Imperium' in the beginning of the year 56 uc. Now, Iam notswsre of
any public commission which he received in the interval between his return from the
East in 61 rec. and his second consulship in 55 lte, except the two following:
(1) Thnt of superintending. as one of a Commission of Twenty, the allotment of the
Cempsninn domnius (cp. pp. 163 84): und (r) the supervision of the supply of corn
with which he was entrnsted in Sept. 57 ue. It is doubtful if the ⁸ Imperium' vves
conferred upon him in connection with the first of these commissione with regerd to
the second, Dion Cassius (39, 9) speaks of his receiving proconsular power; Appisn
(Bell. Civ. a. 18} misdctes the commission, but speaks of Pompey as αὐτοκράτορα τῆς
ames: und Plutarch (Pomp. 49) uses langnage suggesting that he was invented with

· ‘mpeeumx

On the other haud. it is clear that Pompey entered the ‘urbs' on various oocesions
during the spring of 56 uc. (cp. Epp. 23, ²3 5 ; 24, 1 ; 29, 7); und unless special
privileges hed boen granted him he must heve forfeited his ‘ Imperium' thereby. Cp.
Note E, p. ¹²4· 1t is not surprising, therefore, that Becker (liundbueh der Rbnu Alt.
r. r, 66-69) should infer thet Pompey had boen invested with ‘Potestas ' only, aud not
with ‘Imperinmss But Becker does not notice the words quoted above from Ep. nr, 5.
Mr. Yonge, on Ad Fam. 1. 9, 7, hints thet a special permission allowed Pompey to
enter the city without forfeiting his ‘Imperium ;' this is possible, but I do not see any
evidence of it beyond the passages which cause the difficulty: Lange, Rbrn. Alt. 3.
308, thinks thut Pompey received the ordinary proconsules ‘Imperium' for five years.

On the whole, our materisls perhaps do not justify a decided opinion on either side.
Α correspondent (J. J. Q.) hes suggested thet ‘etiam,’ in liner of the above note,

may mean ‘praeter eum,' sc. Pompeium. Pompey, if this interpretation be correct,

need only have been invested with ‘ potestas' But this does not seem tome e natural

wey of interpreting the passage.
