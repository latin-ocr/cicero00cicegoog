colonies. Cp. Madv. Opusc. Acad. 1. 263. The composition
of the population oi the earlier Latin colonies-at least of those
founded before 384 a.c.-is more doubtful.

All the Latin communities appear to have enjoyed the rights of Roman
citizens with regard to the tenure and acquisition of property (ius com·
mercii). Cp. Cic. Pro Caec. 35, 102. Whether they, or any of them,
had the right oi intermarriage with Roman citizens (ius connubii)
is doubtful. Cp. Livy 1. 493 4, 33 Dionys. Hal. Rom. Ant. 6. ις
Mommsen, Rom. Hist. 1. 110; 351; 359; 433; Madv. Opusc. Acad.

Aiiy ciiiien of such towns could acquire the Roman full citizenship in
two ways especially.—

1. By having held office in his own city. Cp. supr. p. ²²7 and reff.
z. By leaving a son to represent him there¹. Livy 41. 8.

The cities ol the Latins held a place, though the most favoured place,
among the ‘civitates foederatae! Cp. Cic. Pro Balb. 24, 54; Philipp.
a· ό, 15·

IV. Other allied communities. The condition oi these was determined
by special treaties, and in some cases it was so favourable that they were
unwilling to change it for that of full Roman citizens (Cic. Pro Balb. 8.
zr; Livy ²3· πο).

Capua, Atella, Calatia, and Tarentum, after their revolt and reduction
in the second Punic war, and the Brutii after the close of that war, seem
to have held an exceptionally bad position. Cp. Livy 26. 163 App.
Annib. 613A. Geli. N. Α. 10.3 ; Strab. 6. 3, 4 orC 281; hiarquardt

B. I. The ‘Lex Iulia de civitate sociorum,' enacted in 90 nc, con·
ferred the full Roman franchise on all the communities in Italy proper
which had remained faithful to Rome in the hiarsic war up to that time,

provided that the several communities were willing to accept it. Its
provisions applied to all the Latin colonies then existing in Italy and
in Cisalpine Gaul, and subsequent legislation extended the privileges of

Roman citizenship still more widely. It is probable that at the time oi
Cicero’s greatest activity as an advocate and politician all communities
in Italy proper had received the full Roman franchise, and had, with the
exception oi recent colonies of Roman citizens, become ‘municipia'

II. Thus a new class of municipia was formed, the third of those
mentioned by Paulus Diaconus (Fest. 127). It comprised theold Latin
and other allied towns, the Latin colonies, and probably a farge maJ'ority

¹ Marquardt (1. 55) believes that this privilege, with some others, was withdrawn
from colonies founded in and subsequently to 268 Β. e.
