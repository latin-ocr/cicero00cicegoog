1. Septem aquas. Some springs, dis·
tant about five miles lrom the lake. Axius
may have had another villa there. The
Septem aquae are mentioned by Dionys.
Hal. Rom. Ant. 1. 14.

Fonteii. M. or Μ’. Fonteius, pro-
praetor ci Gallia Narbonensis from 77 to
75 n.c., was defended by Cicero in 69
ac„ on acharge of maladministration.
‘Pomptini’ has been suggested, as C.
Pomptinus triumphed over the Allobroges.
Cp. Ad Att. 4. 1⁶, ¹²3 Ad (ζ F. 3. 4, 6.

3. Aequabill, ‘unisona ‘general'
Manutius suggests ‘unmixed with bisses?

4. Antiphonti. l'cssibly a freedman
σι’ ΜίΙο. lt was not, apparently, usual to
give slave actors their lreedom till aster
procl of their talent; Antiphon, therefore,
was greatly favoured

operam, ac. ‘dedi’

5. Pendaaa, ‘ be in suspense! Cicero
more usually has ‘pendere animi’ cr
‘animis' Streich. 182.

6. Pusillum, ‘mean,' ‘insignificant’

7. In Andromacha, ‘in the character
cl Andromache: which he filled in a play
ol Ennius so named. This shows that
men took female parts in tragcdy at Rome.

Maior, either ‘tollen’ or ‘more im-
portant!

Quam Astyanax. The best MS. has
‘quam Astya,' which Schiitz supposes to
be the name ol another actor.

8. Parem. The context seems tc re·
uire some word meaning ‘equally bad!
{icero may bc writiug ironically. Pros.
ffyrrelll renders ‘onhr the acme size aa
imsel'

Arbuscula, a well-known female
dancer. Cp. Hor. Sat. 1. 10, 77, and
Orelli'anote.

Cp. Ad Fam. 7. 1, 33 also Ep. 9, 1.

10. In campum, sc. ‘Martium’ ‘to the
scene ol the elections.'

rr. Faenus . . bessibus. The rate ol
interest called ‘centesimae usurae,’ was
one per cent. per month; one ‘aa’
lor every hundred ‘asses’ per mouth.
Lcwer rates ol interest were expressed by
taking fractions ol the ‘as,' as though lor
one per cent. per month the expression
‘asses usurae,’ instead ol ‘centesimae
usurae,’ had been used. Thus, il ‘asses
usurae’=1 per cent. per month=12 per
cent. per year.
trientes=lpercentpermonth=4peryear,
besses ⁵} rr rr ¹¹8 n
Cicero (Ad Att. 1. ra, 1) complains that
he cannot borrow lrom a particular money·
lender at a lower rate than ‘centesimae‚'
aud in another passage (Ad Fam. 5. 6, 2)
says, ‘omnino semissibus magnacopia est.’
-1 thinlc, therefore, that there is nc
difficulty in taking the words ‘triente'
and ‘bessibus' here in their ordinary sense,
though the rates seem rather lower than
might be ex ted to have prevailed when
the deman sor money was great. Nor
can 1 see how Dean Merivalc (1. 441)
gcts the meaning ‘8 per cent. per month’
out of the wor s.—l hare been led tc
reconsider my opinion cn this passage by
Mr. J. R King'a remarks in the Academy
lor Feb. 15, 1871. »

Domitium: cp. Ep. 23, 6.
