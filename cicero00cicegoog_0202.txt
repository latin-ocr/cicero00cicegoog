at once applied himself to redress some of its more serious grievances ¹.
The change made a great impression on the provincials, but Appius was
offended², and thought that Cicero might have some sinister motive for
his reforms. Cicero was especially vigilant in repressing all exactions
by³ his retinue, but was perhaps less⁴ successful than he supposed.

He had directed lll. Anneius, one of his legates, to assemble his forces
at leonium⁶. He himself appeared in the camp on Aug. 24· His ad·
ministration had conciliated⁶ the subjects and allies of Rome, and he
raised a large force of retired soldiers—‘ evocati! He thus felt tolerably
secure when on Sept. 1 news arrived⁷ that a large Parthian army had
crossed the Euphrates. He decided to leave Cilicia to its natural de·
fences, and to take upa position at Cybistra on the borders of Cappa·
docia, whence he might watch the wavering princes of the neighbour-
hood⁸. He there received an offer from Deiotarus, king of Galatia,
under whose protection⁰ the young Ciceros were staying, to support him
with all his forces. This offer Cicero gladly accepted; but having heard
first that the Parthians were threatening Cilicia, and afterwards that they
had retired from Antioch, he sent to Deiotarus to say that he need
not come.

§aa The protection of Cicero's army had emboldened some of the
accomplices in a plot against Ariobarzanes of Cappadocia to make dis·
closures ¹⁰ which led to its frustration. Cicero now marched southwards,
and entered Cilicia proper, arriving at Tarsus on ¹¹ Oct. 5. Shortly after·
wards he attaeked with success the mountaineers of the Amanus between
Cilicia and Commagene, and was saluted Imperator. The year's opera-
tions ended with the capture of the strong town of Pindenissus, which
surrendered Dec. 17, after a siege of 57 days ¹². Cicero allowed his sol·
diers to retain all the plunder except the horses, and sold his prisoners
for the benerit of the treasury, apparently ¹⁸. Then, leaving his brother in
command for the winter, he went to Laodicea. He rejected all ¹⁴ offers
of statues and temples to be raised in his honour.

The dreaded Parthian invasion had taken place, but with little result.
Surenas, the victor of Chartae, had incurred the suspicion of King
Orodes, who ordered his execution3 and Pacorus, son of Orodes, ad-
vised bya chief named Osaces, now commanded. The Parthians were
repulsed near Antioch by Cassius, and Osaces was mortally wounded¹⁶.
But Cicero did not think much of the success, and Bibulus, who pre-
