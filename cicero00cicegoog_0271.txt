222 M. 'I'ULLII CICERONIS [unus 11.

quoniam ex senatus consulto provinciam haberet, lege Cornelia
imperium habiturum, quoad in urbem introisset. Ego, quid ad te
tuorum quisque necessariorum scribat, nescio; varias esse opi-
niones intellego: sunt qui putant posse te non decedere, quod

5 sine lege curiata tibi succedatur; sunt etiam, qui, si decedas, a te
relinqui posse qui provinciae praesit. Mihi non tam de iure
certum est-quamquam ne id quidem valde dubium est—quam
illud, ad tuam summam amplitudinem, dignitatem, libertatem, qua
te scio libentissime frui solere, pertinere te sine ulla mora pro·

ro vinciam successori concedere, praesertim cum sine suspitione
tuae cupiditatis non possis illius cupiditatem refutare. Ego utrum·
que meum puto esse, et quid sentiam ostendere et quod feceris
defendere.
